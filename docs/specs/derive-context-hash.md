## Abstract

`deriveContextHash` is a wallet API method that derives a
deterministic 32-byte value from the wallet's key material, an
application name, and an application-provided context string. It
uses HKDF-SHA-256 (IETF RFC 5869) and is designed for cross-wallet
compatibility — any conforming implementation produces the same
output for the same key material, application name, and context.

The method is generic. The wallet has no knowledge of what the
derived value is used for. Applications provide an application
name and an opaque context; the wallet displays the application
name in its approval dialog and returns a deterministic output.

---

## 1. Motivation

Applications need a deterministic secret tied to the user's
wallet — one that can be reproduced across sessions and devices
without manual storage. Examples include:

- **Hashlock pre-images** — commit to a secret that can be
  later revealed.
- **One-time signature seeds** — derive seed material for
  signature schemes (WOTS, Lamport) without the user managing
  a separate mnemonic.
- **Deterministic identifiers** — generate wallet-bound values
  that are stable across sessions.

`deriveContextHash` enables applications to avoid generating
secrets for users in the browser directly, which is error-prone
and offers no recovery path.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1 API

```
wallet.deriveContextHash(
  appName: string,
  context: string
) → Promise<string>
```

**Parameters:**
- `appName` — a human-readable application identifier (1–64
  bytes, ASCII lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only:
  `[a-z0-9\-]`). Provides mandatory app-level domain separation:
  two applications using different `appName` values will never
  produce the same output, even if their `context` values
  collide. The wallet MUST display `appName` in the approval
  dialog so the user can see which application is requesting
  the derivation. `appName` is caller-supplied and is not, by
  itself, an authenticated identity signal; a malicious
  application can choose any allowed string. Wallets MUST
  reject `appName` values containing characters outside the
  allowed set.
  Examples: `"babylon-vault"`, `"ordinals-market"`.
- `context` — hex-encoded byte string (even-length, lowercase,
  no `0x` prefix). Application-specific data that determines the
  output within the app's namespace. Different contexts produce
  independent outputs. Must not be empty.

**Returns:**
- Hex-encoded 32-byte derived value (64 lowercase hex chars).

**Errors:**
- `appName` is empty, exceeds 64 bytes, or contains characters
  outside `[a-z0-9\-]`.
- Context is empty, odd-length, contains non-hex characters
  (including uppercase `A–F`), has a `0x` prefix, or exceeds
  1024 bytes (2048 hex characters).
- User rejects the approval dialog.
- Wallet does not support the method.

**User approval required.** The wallet MUST show a confirmation
dialog before deriving and returning the value. The dialog
MUST display the `appName` and the requesting origin. The
dialog SHOULD also display the context bytes.

### 2.2 Derivation Algorithm

```
ikm    = BIP-32 private key at path m/73681862'
salt   = "derive-context-hash"        (UTF-8 encoded)
info   = SHA-256(UTF8(appName)) || context  (raw bytes)
length = 32

output = HKDF-SHA-256(ikm, salt, info, length)
```

The `info` field is constructed by concatenating the SHA-256
hash of the UTF-8 encoded `appName` (32 bytes, fixed-length)
with the raw context bytes decoded from hex. Hashing `appName`
ensures it occupies a fixed 32-byte prefix, eliminating
length-confusion collisions between different `appName`/`context`
combinations (e.g. appName `"foobar"` + context `0x01` vs
appName `"foo"` + context `0x626172_01` can never collide).

**IKM (Input Key Material):** The raw 32-byte private key scalar
at BIP-32 derivation path `m/73681862'` (hardened), using
standard BIP-32 derivation on secp256k1. This is the 32-byte
big-endian scalar `k` only — excluding chain code, depth,
fingerprint, child number, and any serialization prefix. If
BIP-32 derivation produces an invalid child key (IL ≥ curve
order or resulting key is zero), the wallet MUST return an error
rather than skip to the next index.

The purpose index `73681862` is derived deterministically:
`trunc31_be(SHA-256("derive-context-hash"))`. This avoids
collision with registered BIP-43 purpose values (BIP-44 `44'`,
BIP-85 `83696968'`, etc.) and the reserved range
`10001'–19999'`.

The derivation path is dedicated to this method — it MUST NOT
be used for signing or any other BIP-32 derivation. Using a
BIP-32 derived key (rather than the raw BIP-39 seed) ensures
hardware wallets can run the entire derivation internally on
the secure element without exporting the private key. This
requires a dedicated device app; the stock Bitcoin app on
Ledger/Trezor does not support this operation.

The derivation path is fixed regardless of the wallet's active
account or network. All accounts derived from the same seed
share the same `deriveContextHash` root. Applications that need
per-account isolation MUST encode an account identifier in
their context.

**Imported private keys:** Wallets that support imported (non-HD)
private keys MAY offer `deriveContextHash` for those keys. Since
imported keys lack a BIP-32 hierarchy, the wallet SHOULD use the
raw 32-byte private key directly as IKM, skipping BIP-32
derivation. Outputs from imported keys are not cross-wallet
compatible — this is inherent to imported keys, which have no
shared derivation tree. Wallets MUST clearly document this
behavior to users and application developers.

Note: BIP-39 passphrases produce different seeds from the same
mnemonic. Two wallets with the same mnemonic but different
passphrases will produce different outputs.

**Salt:** The fixed UTF-8 string `"derive-context-hash"`.
Provides domain separation from BIP-32 and other HMAC-based
derivation schemes. For future revisions, a `-v1`, `-v2`, etc.
suffix can be appended to the salt to indicate the version of
the scheme. The current `derive-context-hash` salt is version 0
without a suffix.

**Length:** 32 bytes (256 bits).

### 2.3 Context Encoding Guidance

The `context` field is opaque bytes from the wallet's
perspective, but applications constructing multi-field contexts
SHOULD use a canonical encoding to avoid ambiguity. Recommended
approach: length-prefix each field.

```
context = len(field1) || field1 || len(field2) || field2 || ...
```

Where `len` is the byte length encoded as a 4-byte big-endian
unsigned integer. This prevents concatenation collisions (e.g.
fields `"AB" + "CD"` vs `"A" + "BCD"` producing identical
context bytes).

For fixed-length fields (txids, public keys), length prefixes
are optional but still recommended for consistency. Applications
MUST NOT rely on the wallet to parse or validate context
structure —
the wallet treats context as opaque bytes.

### 2.4 HKDF-SHA-256

HKDF (RFC 5869) is a two-stage key derivation function:

1. **Extract:** `PRK = HMAC-SHA-256(salt, ikm)` — concentrates
   the entropy of the IKM into a pseudorandom key.
2. **Expand:** `output = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK, info || 0x01)` —
   derives the output keyed on the context. (For 32-byte output,
   only one HMAC block is needed.)

Implementations SHOULD use a well-audited HKDF library (e.g.
`@noble/hashes/hkdf`, OpenSSL, libsodium). Implementations
SHOULD zero intermediate key material (PRK) after use where the
runtime permits (native/firmware). In garbage-collected
environments (JavaScript), explicit zeroization is best-effort.

## 3. Example Use Case: Babylon Trustless Bitcoin Vault Deposits

This section is informational — it describes how Babylon uses
`deriveContextHash` as a concrete example.

Babylon's trustless Bitcoin vault deposit flow requires
depositors to commit to a secret and reveal that same secret
later during activation. The secret is the preimage of a
SHA-256 hash embedded in a Bitcoin hashlock script.

Babylon constructs the context from deterministic values that
are available both when creating the deposit and later when
revealing the secret, for example:

```
context = (dummyPrePeginTxid, htlcVout, depositorPubkey)
```

The application calls
`deriveContextHash("babylon-vault", context)`, computes
`SHA-256(deriveContextHash("babylon-vault", context))` to get
the hashlock, and later reconstructs the same context from
on-chain state to derive and reveal the same preimage on
Ethereum.

A future use case is WOTS (Winternitz One-Time Signature) seed
derivation — the wallet provides a 32-byte seed via
`deriveContextHash`, and the application expands it into WOTS
keypairs in WASM. This would eliminate the separate mnemonic that users
currently manage for Lamport key signing.
