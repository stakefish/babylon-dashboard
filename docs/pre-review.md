# Pre-review

`/pre-review` runs an AI review of a change on the author's machine before
the PR is opened. It shows findings in the session with a recommended
decision for each, fixes the ones the author chooses, re-checks only what
changed on the next run, and keeps `PR.md` (the PR description) current. The
human reviewer then starts from code that already passed an AI review, plus a
record of what that review found and what happened to each finding.

CI-side bot review (Greptile) is unaffected. `/pre-review` covers the stage
before any PR exists.

## Requirements

- Claude Code, started in this repository, ideally the same session that
  implemented the change: it already knows what the change is for.
- Node 24 and a working `pnpm install`. The review runs
  `pnpm nx affected` for `lint`, `typecheck` and `test`, as three separate
  invocations: lint first, because it can rewrite files, then typecheck, then
  tests in the background. `nx affected` covers the projects the changed files
  belong to **and every project that depends on them**, so a one-line edit in
  `babylon-tbv-rust-wasm` pulls in `ts-sdk` and `ledger-vault-signer`, and
  through the latter `wallet-connector` and `simple-staking`, and `vault`.
  That is six projects for lint and typecheck — the five dependents plus the
  wasm package itself, which carries both scripts — and five for test, since
  the wasm package has no `test` script. Read a reported count against which
  invocation it came from, not against one number.

## Workflow

1. Implement the change.
2. Run `/pre-review`. The findings appear in the session, each with a
   recommendation: **fix now**, **follow-up** (a later PR), or **decline**
   (with a reason).
3. Accept the recommendations or change any of them (for example "7
   follow-up, 12 decline: duplicate of the VP check").
4. Fix the fix-now items: the session offers to do it, or fix them by hand.
5. Run `/pre-review` again. It verifies fixes and checks changed code,
   affected callers and open findings. Repeat until the fixes are verified
   and decisions are recorded.
6. Run `/pre-review --final`. It completes pending fix checks, then runs one
   independent reviewer over the whole change. If it finds a blocker, fix
   it, verify the fix and run `--final` on the new candidate.
7. Commit, push, and open the PR with `PR.md` as the body. Human code review
   is still required. See
   [Enforcement](#enforcement).

Arguments are optional:

| Argument | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--full` | Force the full reviewer set over the whole change, even when the change qualifies for the light tier or nothing has changed since the last run. |
| `--final` | Complete pending review and checks, then run one independent whole-change review. Reuse a completed final result only when its inputs are unchanged. Combine with `--full` to force a new full review and final review. |
| `--pr <n>` | The branch's PR number. Only used after a push, to read the posted body back and confirm it uploaded intact. Without it that check is skipped — the session will not ask, because a typed answer mid-run makes every command after it prompt. |
| `--ci "<summary>"` | CI results you have read yourself. Passed to the reviewers attributed to you; the session cannot see CI and says nothing about it otherwise. |
| anything else | A scope hint, passed to the reviewers unchanged. The session adds no steer of its own. |

`--final` on a new branch still runs the initial review tier. An ordinary run
cannot report completion without a valid final result. Changed code, base
or review context invalidates that result. Open blockers, failed or missing
checks, and missing review coverage prevent completion.

From the first run, reviewers omit cosmetic preferences and optional
refactors unless they expose a defect or break a required rule. Incorrect
user-facing text, specification errors and required document changes remain
in scope. Settled findings reopen only when new evidence changes the result.

`PR.md` is written on the first run and updated on every run after it. The
session asks up to two questions on the first run when it cannot tell what
the change is for. Edits made to `PR.md` by hand are kept wherever they are
still true. Decisions are recorded before any fix starts, so an interrupted
fix loses nothing.

## Tiers

The size and location of the change decide how many reviewers run.

| Tier  | When                                                                             | Reviewers                                            |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| light | No CLAUDE.md critical-path file, changed lines within the threshold, contained impact, no `--full` | `review-generalist`                                  |
| full  | Anything else                                                                    | `review-generalist`, `review-tracer`, `review-panel` |

The threshold is `LIGHT_REVIEW_MAX_CHANGED_LINES` in
`.claude/skills/pre-review/SKILL.md`, a starting value to be tuned from pilot
data. Changed lines exclude `pnpm-lock.yaml` and the generated
`packages/babylon-ts-sdk/docs/api/`.

Later runs use one reviewer to verify earlier findings and inspect the new
changes with their affected callers. They use the full reviewer set when
changes touch a critical path, exceed the threshold, or have broad or
unclear impact. They also escalate when the whole change grows past the
threshold without a whole-change full review, or when `--full` is passed.
Run count alone never causes a full review.

Only `--final` adds the **cold reviewer**. This reviewer gets the whole
change, rules and intent. It gets no previous findings or review history.
This independent check runs once per candidate, after pending fixes and
checks pass. Unchanged completed final results are reused. Any run with
`--full`, with or without `--final`, discards a completed final result.

An ordinary rerun needs no reviewer when neither the change nor a file named
by an outside finding moved. The same applies when files only left the
change, no outside finding's file moved, and no non-moot finding needs a
verdict for a file that left. Missing reviewer coverage, including on runs
recorded before this flow, is repaired with a whole-change full review on the
next `--final` or `--full` run. An ordinary run only reports it. `--full`
still forces work.
The exact gates and tunable constants are in
`.claude/skills/pre-review/SKILL.md`.

| Reviewer            | Method                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `review-generalist` | Built-in `/code-review` at high effort, plus repo conventions |
| `review-tracer`     | One deep pass tracing the live call path end to end           |
| `review-panel`      | Up to four focused lanes, each finding re-verified            |

All reviewers are defined in `.claude/agents/` without the Edit and Write
tools, and their instructions forbid touching the working tree or the index.
That is not a sandbox: each reviewer keeps Bash, and `review-panel` can
spawn subagents, so what actually stops a stray write is the author's
permission rules. Review commands that a local allowlist approves (for
example `git stash`) would run without a prompt.

## Files

Four files hold the review, all git-ignored and local to the author.
`<key>` is the branch name with `/` replaced by `__`. The reviewed file
contents themselves are stored as unreferenced git objects, which git prunes
after about two weeks; a later run then reviews those files whole again.

| File                     | Purpose                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PR.md`                  | Working copy of the current branch's description, for opening the PR     |
| `.pre-review/<key>.md`   | The branch's description, ending with a collapsed record of the findings |
| `.pre-review/<key>.json` | State between runs: reviewed file contents and findings with decisions   |
| `.pre-review/<key>.context.txt` | Stable review context used to detect stale final results |

`PR.md` is shared by every branch, so the session checks which branch it
belongs to before using or replacing it; each branch's own copy lives in
`.pre-review/`. The state file is not meant to be edited: decisions are made
in the session. Formats are in `.claude/skills/pre-review/formats.md`.

## Reading the pre-review record

The end of `PR.md`, and so of the PR body, carries a collapsed section:

| Outcome                  | Meaning for the reviewer                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **open — merge-blocker** | Found and not fixed, whatever the decision. A deferred or declined blocker still appears here with its reason, and still counts in the header. Raise it. |
| open                     | Found, not fixed yet: either to be fixed, or not yet decided. |
| fixed                    | Re-checked on a later run, across every file and symbol the finding named — not only where it pointed. |
| follow-up: …             | Deferred to a later PR; also listed under "Not in this PR". A deferred merge-blocker is listed there too, but shows above as a blocker. |
| declined: …              | The author judged it not worth fixing; the reason is theirs. A declined merge-blocker does not render here — it shows above as a blocker with its reason, so the header's `declined` count can read 0 while a declined finding is visible in the table. |
| moot                     | None of the finding's files is part of the change any more. Not used for a finding anchored on a file outside the change: those are tracked separately and re-judged when that file changes, so they can come back `fixed`, `open` or regressed. Not used either for one whose cause the author removed — that is `fixed`. |

> **Note**: The findings and decisions are self-reported: they show what the
> author's review found and decided. CI checks only that a record for the
> branch is present, not what the review concluded.

## Cost

A light initial review uses one reviewer. A full review uses three reviewers
and up to four lanes. An ordinary fix check uses one reviewer unless the
changes require escalation. `--final` adds one cold reviewer when a new
final review is needed.

The state records reported tokens, tool calls and duration for each reviewer.
Each run reports its cost and total reported reviewer tokens across all runs
for the branch. Missing figures remain `null`, and the total is marked
partial. These figures do not include all session or model costs.

## Changing the tooling

The skill (`.claude/skills/pre-review/`) and the reviewers
(`.claude/agents/review-*.md`) are ordinary repository files: change them
through a PR. A personal skill with the same name in `~/.claude/skills/`
takes precedence over the project one, so do not keep a private copy named
`pre-review`.

## Enforcement

The `pre-review-check` CI job runs on every PR to `main`. It reads the hidden
snapshot line in the PR description and passes when `/pre-review` ran on the
PR's branch: the line's `branch=` is the PR's head branch.

The check requires a record from the PR's branch in the description. It does
not compare the code with the record. What happens after a run is the
author's to own: fixing the findings, running `/pre-review` again to verify
the fixes (recommended), and any change pushed later, such as fixes for
review comments.

| Result       | Cause                                                  | What to do                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| missing      | The description has no record                          | Run `/pre-review`, then paste `PR.md` as the description |
| other-branch | The record was taken on another branch                 | Run `/pre-review` on this branch, then paste `PR.md`     |
| ambiguous    | The description has two different snapshot lines       | Run `/pre-review` again, then paste the updated `PR.md`  |
| malformed    | A snapshot line cannot be read, e.g. a quoted template | Remove it, or run `/pre-review` again and paste `PR.md`  |

The job updates one comment on the PR with the result, and re-runs when the
description is edited, so pasting a new `PR.md` is enough to clear it.

> **Note**: Once `/pre-review` is standard practice, the plan is to compare the
> record with the code again: find the commit holding the reviewed content
> through the snapshot's `files-sha256` digest, and require a new run when the
> change since that commit exceeds `LIGHT_REVIEW_MAX_CHANGED_LINES` or touches
> a CLAUDE.md critical path. The TODO is on `checkSnapshot` in
> `scripts/pre-review/snapshot.mjs`.

The check passes without reading the description in three cases:

- the PR carries the `skip-pre-review` label, for a change too small to
  review (a typo, a version bump). The label is visible to every reviewer;
- the PR is a draft. The check runs when it is marked ready for review;
- the PR was opened by a bot.

> ⚠️ **Important**: The check proves that a record is present, not that the
> review ran: a snapshot line can be written by hand. The findings table in
> the description makes a skipped review visible to the human reviewer.

The job runs on `pull_request_target`: GitHub takes the workflow and
`scripts/pre-review/` from `main`, not from the PR, so a PR cannot edit the
check it is judged by. It could still add a workflow of its own with a job of
the same name; that file shows in the diff, so reviewers should look for one.
A change to the check takes effect only after it merges, and
`pre-review-scripts.yml` tests the scripts on the PR that changes them. The
`pull_request_target` event has a write token, which is safe because the job
never checks out or runs the PR's code; keep it that way when changing the
workflow.

### Local warnings

Two optional helpers report a missing record before CI does. Both read the
branch's `.pre-review/<key>.md`.

- **Git pre-push hook.** Installed by `pnpm install` (husky). It prints a
  warning for each pushed branch without a record and never blocks the push.
- **Claude Code hook.** Denies `gh pr create` when Claude runs it on a branch
  without a record, and tells the session to hand `/pre-review` back to you.
  It lets through PRs the CI job does not check: a draft (`--draft`) and a PR
  into a branch other than `main` (`--base`/`-B`, e.g. a stacked PR). Any
  command with `--repo`/`-R` is also allowed, even one naming this repository,
  whose PR CI still checks.
  `.claude/settings.json` is not committed, so add it to your own settings:

  ```json
  {
    "hooks": {
      "PreToolUse": [
        {
          "matcher": "Bash",
          "hooks": [
            {
              "type": "command",
              "if": "Bash(gh pr create *)",
              "command": "node \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/scripts/pre-review/claude-pr-create-hook.mjs\""
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

  The script checks the command itself and ignores anything but
  `gh pr create`. The `if` filter only avoids starting it for every other
  Bash call; it matches a command that starts with `gh pr create`, not one
  chained after another command with `&&`. Flag detection is best effort, not
  a shell parser: a draft flag (`-d`, `--draft`, `--draft=true`), a non-`main`
  `--base`/`-B` or a `--repo`/`-R` anywhere after `gh pr create` counts,
  including one quoted inside a title or body or in a command chained after
  it (`gh pr create --fill && git branch -d old` reads as a draft).
