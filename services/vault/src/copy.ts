/**
 * Centralized user-facing copy for the vault dApp.
 *
 * All user-visible text (labels, status messages, button text, step
 * descriptions, modal copy) lives here. Components and hooks should import
 * strings from this file rather than inlining them.
 *
 * Why a single file:
 * - One place to audit for English correctness and tone.
 * - Eliminates capitalization / phrasing drift across screens.
 * - Easier to wire up future i18n without hunting strings across the tree.
 *
 * Contract / on-chain error messages live in
 * `src/utils/errors/errorMessages.ts` because they are keyed by ABI error
 * name. Treat that file as part of "copy" for editing purposes.
 *
 * Style rules used here:
 * - "Pre-Pegin" (proper-noun form) for the broadcast phase / transaction.
 * - "peg-in" (lowercase, hyphenated) in regular prose.
 * - "vault provider" lowercase mid-sentence; capitalized only when
 *   sentence-leading.
 * - "BTCVault" (capitalized, one word) when naming the product or a
 *   depositor's vault; never bare "vault". The "vault provider" /
 *   "vault keeper" role terms are the only exception.
 * - Status labels use sentence case (e.g. "Signing required").
 * - Past-tense broadcast statements use "has been broadcast", never bare
 *   "broadcast" as a participle.
 * - American English spelling (e.g. "acknowledgments", not
 *   "acknowledgements").
 * - Button labels are intentionally per-context: primary CTAs use Title
 *   Case (e.g. "Submit WOTS Key", "Broadcast Pre-Pegin", "Add BTCVault"),
 *   while in-flow / dialog buttons use sentence case (e.g. "Activate",
 *   "Do not split", "View on blockchain explorer"). Match the
 *   surrounding screen rather than imposing a single rule.
