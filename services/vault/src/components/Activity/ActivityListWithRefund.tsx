/**
 * ActivityListWithRefund — the v3 activity feed, plus the expired deposit's
 * HTLC refund.
 *
 * Split out of the page so it is the v3 branch alone that mounts the deposit
 * lifecycle: `usePendingDeposits`, the protocol params and the refund modals.
 * v2 renders ActivityList directly and keeps its original behaviour — a
 * refundable-expired deposit still reads "Pending" there, and none of this
 * scaffolding is instantiated.
 *
 * Peg-in polling is NOT mounted here: `AppPeginPollingProvider` sits above
 * `<Outlet>` in RootLayout, so this subtree already has it. A second mount
 * would fork the polling and optimistic-completion state.
