 *
 * Three values are derived (no new financial model — see issue #2043):
 *  - post-liquidation Health Factor: remaining collateral × price × CF ÷ debt.
 *    Uses the collateral factor, matching `calculate.ts`, NOT the SDK's
 *    liquidation-threshold HF.
 *  - fairness payment in wBTC: `fairnessPaymentUsd / group.liquidationPrice`
 *    — the event's own trigger price, not the simulated price, since the
 *    fairness payment is a property of that liquidation, not of wherever the
 *    simulator currently sits.
 *  - Sacrificial vs Protected badge: no backing field exists. `calculate.ts`
 *    emits groups in seizure order but with a 1-based `index` field, so
 *    "first group" is the group's POSITION in the `groups` array (position 0),
 *    never `group.index` itself. The first-position group is the sacrificial
 *    one; the rest are protected.
