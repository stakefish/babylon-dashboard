 * - aave scope:     `AaveIntegrationAdapter` — governs borrow/reorder/repay.

 *
 * This gate covers governance SCOPE only. The registry also requires the
 * vault's own application registration to be Active on the redeem path
 * (`ApplicationNotActive`); that is per-vault rather than per-scope, so it is
 * read by `useVaultApplicationActive` and applied at the confirm screen.
 *
 * Both are point-in-time. Neither closes the window between a passing check
 * and the transaction mining — a registration deactivated after the check
 * still mines a reverting tx with the secret in public calldata. What the
 * checks buy is not offering an action that cannot succeed; the enforcement
 * that actually refuses to sign is `executeWrite`'s mandatory pre-broadcast
