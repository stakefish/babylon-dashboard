/**
 * Assert that an indexer-supplied proxy contract matches the user's on-chain
 * proxy before it is used for any live Aave Spoke read or to size a repayment.
 *
 * The position service and the full-repay path take `proxyContract` from
 * GraphQL and pass it directly to Spoke reads (health factor, account data,
 * debt discovery) and to `getUserTotalDebt` (which sizes the full-repay
 * amount). A compromised indexer can return the victim's real position record
 * but swap `proxyContract` for one with less debt / healthier collateral —
 * corrupting every risk figure and the full-repay amount. Settlement is always
 * against the connected wallet, so funds can't be redirected, but the figures
 * the user signs against can be falsified. This guard resolves the proxy
 * on-chain and fails closed if it disagrees.
 *
 * Resolves the proxy on-chain from the env-pinned adapter the tx path uses
 * (via `getAaveAdapterAddress()` at the call site), never from an
 * indexer-derived address. Otherwise an attacker-controlled adapter could
 * return a matching proxy that passes the check while the real position lives
 * elsewhere.
