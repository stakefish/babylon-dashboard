/**
 * Clear the FULL debt for a reserve via the adapter's repay-all sentinel.
 *
 * Quotes the position's fee-inclusive total debt from its proxy (the Spoke
 * quote excludes the adapter's interest fee), approves
 * `min(quote + buffer, balanceRaw)`, and sends `maxUint256`: the adapter
 * re-resolves the fee-inclusive debt inside the repay tx and pulls exactly
 * that, hitting the contract's exact full-repay branch — every debt share is
 * burned, so no rounding dust can survive. The proxy quote is a hard
 * dependency: a failed read blocks with a retryable error rather than
 * degrading to a fee-blind amount.
 *
 * Approval semantics (all consciously accepted):
 * - Success leaves `cap − pulled` allowance standing (≈ the buffer for funded
 *   users); a failure after approval leaves the whole cap. The spender is the
 *   env-pinned adapter, and the adapter derives the position from `borrower`
 *   on-chain, so an allowance can only ever clear the user's own debt.
 * - A standing allowance from a prior session short-circuits the approve, so
 *   the pull is bounded by that OLD allowance with no popup this session (and
 *   an unlimited standing allowance survives undecremented per ERC-20).
 * - forceApprove re-asserts the same cap (no re-quote): it only fires on the
 *   stale-HIGH-allowance-read path, where re-assertion is the fix.
