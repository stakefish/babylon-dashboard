/**
 * Prove what asset a reserve actually is, before its label or any of its
 * amounts reach the screen.
 *
 * The loan detail screen used to take the reserve's symbol, name and decimals
 * straight from the GraphQL indexer. A compromised indexer could keep a real
 * `reserveId`/`underlying` pair but spoof the symbol, so the page labelled one
 * asset while the transaction targeted another — and report decimals that made
 * the displayed debt and Max differ from the amount actually signed.
 *
 * This resolves the identity from sources the indexer does not control:
 *  1. `assertReserveMatchesOnChain` proves `reserveId -> underlying` against
 *     the env-pinned adapter's spoke — the only authority on which token the
 *     page is about.
 *  2. `getERC20Decimals(underlying)` supplies decimals. This is the exact
 *     helper the borrow/repay signing paths use, so display and signing can't
 *     disagree.
 *  3. The address-keyed token registry supplies the label, falling back to the
 *     token contract's own `symbol()`/`name()` for addresses it doesn't know
 *     (testnet/devnet deployments).
 *
 * The indexer's `token.symbol/name/decimals` are never consulted. If no
 * trusted label can be produced, this throws rather than borrowing one.
