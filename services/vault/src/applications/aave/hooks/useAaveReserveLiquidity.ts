/**
 * Batched per-reserve liquidity read from the Aave v4 Hub. Returns
 * `Record<reserveId.toString(), ReserveLiquidity | null>` with available
 * liquidity in token units and utilization in basis points. A reserve is
 * `null` when its read failed (callers render the empty placeholder).
 *
 * Read from the Hub (keyed by `hub`/`assetId`), not the Spoke: the Core Spoke
 * supplies vBTC collateral, not the borrowed asset, so its reserve totals are
 * spoke-local. The Hub holds the shared market — the same place the borrow APR
 * is read — so utilization here stays consistent with the displayed rate.
 *
 * Wallet-less: reads go through the app's public RPC client, so this works on
 * disconnected surfaces (e.g. the asset picker).
