// Authoritative confirmation that a suspected-stuck vault is REALLY still
// unactivated on chain.
//
// The stuck state (VERIFIED + HTLC swept by the pegin tx) is derived from the
// INDEXER's contract status plus a BTC-side probe. Both can be right while the
// conclusion is wrong: activation succeeds on chain, the indexer has not caught
// up, and the vault still reads VERIFIED. The BTC evidence is then entirely
// consistent with a healthy, activated deposit.
//
// That mattered because the only thing standing between a lagging indexer and a
// false "Activation incomplete" was a per-device `localStorage` marker. On a
// second device, or after a cleared profile, the marker is absent: the deposit
// renders as stuck, `useSigningRequiredNotifications` fires a push saying the
// vault could not be activated, and clicking it opens a BTC signing popup -
// the secret is derived before any on-chain status read. A fresh VERIFIED check
// downstream stops real harm, but the user has already been alarmed and asked
// for a signature they did not need to give.
//
// So the stuck state now requires a POSITIVE on-chain confirmation, in the same
// shape as `useActivationDeadlineGate`: the indexer supplies cheap Tier-1
// suspects, and only a chain read that still reports VERIFIED promotes one to
// genuinely stuck.

 *
 * Fails OPEN in every uncertain case: an absent id means "not confirmed stuck",
 * so an RPC failure, an unregistered vault, or a vault the chain already reports
 * ACTIVE all leave the deposit rendering normally. That direction is deliberate.
 * Failing the other way produces exactly the defect this exists to remove — a
 * false alarm plus a signing prompt on a healthy deposit. The cost of failing
 * open is that a genuinely stuck depositor waits one poll interval for the
 * escape hatch to appear, which is recoverable; the cost of failing closed is
 * not.
