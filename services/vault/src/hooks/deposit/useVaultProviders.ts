/**
 * Hook to fetch and cache vault providers and vault keepers (per-application)
 *
 * This hook fetches vault providers and vault keepers from the GraphQL indexer.
 * The data is cached per application entryPoint using React Query.
 *
 * Logos are fetched separately via useLogos hook to avoid blocking provider
 * data on the logo API. Providers are available immediately; logos are merged
 * when they arrive.
 *
 * Note: Universal challengers are system-wide and should be accessed via
 * useProtocolParamsContext() instead.
 *
 * Since provider data rarely changes, we use aggressive caching:
 * - Cache for 5 minutes (staleTime)
 * - Keep in cache for 10 minutes (cacheTime)
 * - Fetch once on mount, don't refetch on window focus
