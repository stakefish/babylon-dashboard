/**
 * useReclaimRowAction — whether a settled vault's row may offer the reclaim of
 * its depositor-claim reserve.
 *
 * Sibling of `useRefundRowAction`, with the same contract plus one outcome of
 * its own:
 *
 *  - `available` — the reclaim can be performed now.
 *  - `blockedTooltip` — the reclaim is the row's action but is not performable;
 *    the row shows a disabled control explaining why. Null when the reclaim is
 *    not this row's action at all, which leaves the row with no action rather
 *    than a permanently disabled button.
 *  - `reclaimableSats` — the reserve's value, for the row's figure. Null until
 *    the chain read lands.
 *  - `needsWallet` — the reclaim would be available to the vault's owner, but
 *    no Bitcoin wallet is connected to verify ownership (an Ethereum-only
 *    session); the row offers the wallet connection in place of the action.
 *
 * Refund and reclaim are mutually exclusive by contract status: refund applies
 * to EXPIRED vaults (no PegIn was ever broadcast), reclaim to
 * DEPOSITOR_WITHDRAWN ones (the PegIn confirmed and the peg-out settled). A row
 * never offers both.
 *
 * The decision itself lives in `models/reclaimEligibility` — read the warning
 * there before changing when this is offered.
