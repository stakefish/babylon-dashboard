/**
 * Non-blocking access to the protocol params the peg-in polling tree needs.
 *
 * Mirrors the `pegInConfig` and `allOffchainParams` queries owned by
 * ProtocolParamsContext and shares their React Query cache via the same keys,
 * so this adds no extra request. Unlike `useProtocolParamsContext` it does NOT
 * block: `PeginPollingProvider` is mounted above the routes that own the
 * blocking provider, and that provider renders a spinner *in place of* its
 * children — depending on it there would gate the whole app on three contract
 * reads and blank it on failure.
 *
 * The resolvers return `undefined` until BOTH queries have landed. (The
 * blocking provider gates on a third, `universalChallengers`, which nothing
 * here reads — so this is the same discipline, not the same gate.) Callers must
 * read `undefined` as "depth not yet known" and withhold any confirmation
 * conclusion — never substitute a default, which would assert a Bitcoin depth
 * the chain has not reached.
