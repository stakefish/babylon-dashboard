// Activation FLOOR gate for VERIFIED vaults — the lower bound the registry
// enforces (`_requireActivationDelayElapsed`), mirroring
// `useActivationDeadlineGate`'s upper bound. Two things differ, and both matter.
//
// 1. FAIL CLOSED. The deadline gate fails open on every error, because
//    over-gating there would lock a depositor out of a valid activation. Here
//    the risk points the other way: letting Activate through early sends the
//    HTLC secret into `simulateContract` calldata and so to the RPC provider,
//    the leak `useVaultActions` already guards against when it insists on an
//    exact-match on-chain VERIFIED. So an unresolved floor gates the vault.
//
// 2. NO WALL-CLOCK ESTIMATE. Every input is read from chain. Slot time is used
//    only to describe a block count in the UI (see `activationFloor.ts`), never
//    to decide whether the window has opened.
//
// The delay is read inside this query rather than taken from
// `ProtocolParamsContext`: that provider caches for minutes and blanks the app
// on any error it owns, while the registry reads `peginActivationDelay()` live
// on every call. Owning the read keeps the gate's decision as fresh as the
// contract's and keeps a missing getter from taking the app down with it.
