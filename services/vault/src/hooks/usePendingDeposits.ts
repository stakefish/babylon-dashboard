/**
 * usePendingDeposits hook
 *
 * Fetches vault deposits and splits them into two lists:
 *  - pendingActivities: in-flight deposits (contractStatus 0=PENDING or 1=VERIFIED).
 *  - expiredActivities: refundable expired deposits (contractStatus 7=EXPIRED with
 *    unsignedPrePeginTx — the only indexer-sourced field required to build the
 *    refund PSBT; hashlock and htlcVout come from the on-chain contract).
 * Provides wallet state and modal handlers for broadcast/refund actions on
 * pending and expired deposits. The post-broadcast actions (WOTS, payout
 * signing, activation, artifact download) are owned by the deposit
 * multistepper opened from the card body, not per-action modals.
 *
 * Polling infrastructure moved to `AppPeginPollingProvider`.
