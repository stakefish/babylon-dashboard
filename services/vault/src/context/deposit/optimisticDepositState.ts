 * swaps its whole content subtree for the geo-block branch, and wallet churn
 * remounts it, either of which would wipe provider-local state mid-flow. Same
 * reasoning as the tracking stores in `terminalMilestones.ts` and
 * `daemonTerminalEvents.ts`.
 *
 * This changes the SCOPE of the signal, not the trust model. It records only
 * outcomes this session watched resolve — it is never persisted, so a reload
 * drops it and the vault provider's polled status is ground truth again. The
 * anti-tamper reconciliation in `applyTrackingOverrides`, which distrusts a
 * localStorage status the VP contradicts, is deliberately left untouched.

/**
 * How long a resolved WOTS submission keeps suppressing "Submit WOTS Key".
 *
 * The marker exists to bridge one gap: our submission has resolved but the VP
 * daemon has not advanced yet, so the poll still reports
 * `PENDING_DEPOSITOR_WOTS_PK`. That lag is seconds to minutes. Past this bound
 * the likelier reading of a VP still asking is that it genuinely wants a key —
 * rejected, rotated, or a write we lost behind a 200 — and an indefinite marker
 * would leave the row with no action at all and no route back short of a
 * reload. So the suppression lapses and the user can retry.
 *
 * Same reasoning as `REFUND_BROADCAST_SUPPRESSION_MS` in `peginStateMachine`,
 * which documents why a suppression marker must never be sticky. Generous
 * against real daemon lag, short enough that a stuck deposit recovers on its
 * own within one sitting.
 *
 * Sized against the continuation modal, not the dashboard row — it is the
 * harsher consumer. `PostDepositContinuationView` renders `ResumeWotsContent`
 * off the same `SUBMIT_WOTS_KEY` action, so a lapse while the VP is merely
 * slow to leave `PENDING_DEPOSITOR_WOTS_PK` bounces a parked user back to the
 * WOTS resume screen with nothing actually wrong. Twenty minutes clears
 * realistic daemon lag for that consumer while still recovering in one sitting.
 *
 * Recovery is bounded by this TTL plus one poll interval, not by the TTL
 * alone: nothing re-renders on the clock crossing the boundary. What carries
 * it is `refetchInterval` — a deposit stuck at `needsWotsKey` keeps polling
 * (it only stops at `pendingDepositorSignatures` or a terminal error) and the
 * queryFn returns fresh `Set`s, which React Query's structural sharing does
 * not descend into, so the deps change every tick and the row re-renders.
