/**
 * Pure transition detector for `activation.daemon.terminal` — a VP daemon
 * terminal drop (Expired / AmlRejected / IngestionRejected / ...) observed by
 * the pegin polling loop. These states stop polling and previously transmitted
 * nothing, so a rejected deposit was invisible to monitoring.
 *
 * Same emission discipline as `terminalMilestones`:
 *  - A vault is SEEDED on the first poll observation that includes it: if it is
 *    already terminal then (a prior-session drop rediscovered on reload), it is
 *    marked emitted WITHOUT emitting, so a dashboard load never emits a burst.
 *  - Thereafter, each distinct terminal daemonStatus emits once per vault —
 *    keyed per status, so a real Expired → ExpiredCleanedUp progression yields
 *    both signals.
 *
 * Seeding is keyed to the POLLED set, not the errors map: a vault only enters
 * the errors map once it errors, so its first appearance there would always
 * look pre-existing and nothing would ever emit.
 *
 * A polled id whose errors entry is a plain (non-terminal) Error is a FAILED
 * observation — provider unreachable, entry omitted or duplicated — so the
 * poll learned nothing about that vault. It neither seeds nor emits; seeding
 * waits for a poll that genuinely observes the vault, otherwise a
 * connectivity blip on the first poll after reload would mis-seed the vault
 * as healthy and its prior-session terminal would emit as a fresh warning.
