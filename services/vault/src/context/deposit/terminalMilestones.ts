/**
 * Pure transition detector for the on-chain deposit-funnel terminals emitted
 * from the polling context: `activation.verified` (VP verified the presigned
 * payouts) and `deposit.completed` (vault ACTIVE — funnel terminal).
 *
 * Emission must be per-vault and once-per-transition. Two rules make that hold
 * against a poll loop that re-runs every cycle:
 *  - A vault is SEEDED on its first indexer-sourced observation: if it is
 *    already at/past a milestone then (a prior-session completion, or a resumed
 *    deposit), it is marked emitted WITHOUT emitting, so a page load never emits
 *    a burst. localStorage-only rows are skipped outright — their status is
 *    fabricated, not observed.
 *  - Thereafter a milestone emits once, the first cycle a seen vault is observed
 *    to have reached that state, and never again.
