/**
 * The BTC key a vault provider's server identity is pinned to for RPC auth.
 *
 * The VP issues BIP-322-signed tokens from its **operation** key, so once
 * RFC-006 rotation is live the pin has to follow that key rather than the
 * fixed registration key. This is deliberately the *current* key, not any
 * vault's frozen epoch: it is a per-operator server identity, not a per-vault
 * binding (RFC-006 open question 5).
 *
 * Consequence worth knowing: `VpTokenRegistry` binds a `peginTxid` to one
 * pinned pubkey and refuses to rebind. A VP that rotates mid-session
 * invalidates its outstanding tokens, which surfaces as an auth failure the
 * user resolves by retrying — the flow re-reads the key on the next cold path.
 * That is the intended behaviour: accepting either key would hollow out the
 * pin, which exists precisely so a substituted server key cannot be used.
 *
 * Centralised here because all three auth-priming call sites must agree; a
 * site left on the registration key would break auth for every vault of a
 * rotated provider, including already-active ones.
