/**
 * Vault activation service — calls activateVaultWithSecret on the contract.
 *
 * After the depositor broadcasts the Pre-PegIn tx and the vault reaches
 * Verified status, the depositor reveals the HTLC secret on Ethereum to
 * move the vault from Verified -> Active. The VP then uses the revealed
 * secret to claim the HTLC on Bitcoin.
 *
 * Protocol logic lives in the SDK (`activateVault`); this adapter wires
 * the vault's contract-write transport (`executeWrite`) into the SDK's
 * injected-writer interface so viem error decoding, simulation, and
 * receipt handling stay in the app tier.

 * publishes the secret. The residual is the simulate-to-mine window: a
 * precondition that flips after a passing simulation (or a lagging RPC
 * replica) still mines a reverting transaction with the secret in public
 * calldata. That window is inherent — any pre-check, including a CTA-time
 * application-status read, is point-in-time in exactly the same way.
