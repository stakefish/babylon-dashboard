/**
 * Service for fetching and saving BaBe Decryptor artifacts.
 *
 * These artifacts are what lets a depositor claim their vault funds without
 * the vault provider's cooperation, so a download that "succeeded" without
 * producing a valid, complete file on disk is a silent loss of that recovery
 * path. Two things follow from that:
 *
 * - **Validation is mandatory and covers the whole body.** The payload is
 *   ~1.3 GB and cannot be parsed with `JSON.parse`, so it is checked
 *   incrementally by {@link ArtifactStreamValidator} as it streams. Nothing
 *   is skipped on the basis of size.
 * - **Success means the bytes are durably saved**, not that a fetch resolved.
 *   The body is piped into an {@link ArtifactSaveTarget} and only committed
 *   after the validator has seen the closing brace.
 *
 * Bytes are validated, hashed, and written chunk-by-chunk in a single pass,
 * so the full body is never held in memory on the File System Access path.
 *
 * The bundle is also bound to the deposit it was requested for: the envelope
 * names no vault, but the transaction graph inside it does, so its claim and
 * payout transactions are checked against the requested pegin txid and its
 * depositor key against the requested one. See `artifactBinding.ts`.
 *
 * What this does NOT establish: that the artifact bytes decrypt correctly. No
 * client-side BaBe verifier exists, so the payload is proven well-formed and
 * addressed to this deposit, never proven usable.
