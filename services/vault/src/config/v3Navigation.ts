/**
 * Single source of truth for the v3 sidebar's six nav sections (path + label
 * + group layout) and for which of them their own feature flag currently
 * enables. Router guards, the header's page title, and the sidebar itself all
 * derive from this instead of maintaining their own copies, so a renamed,
 * re-pathed or newly flag-gated section can't silently desync between them.
 *
 * Icons are deliberately not part of this module — it stays a plain data
 * module (no React, no core-ui) so the router and the `usePageTitle` hook
 * don't have to import a component tree just to read a path/label pair.
 * `components/shared/AppSidebar.tsx` maps `id` -> icon component.
 *
 * Feature flags are only ever read inside the functions below, never into a
 * module-scope constant: the router reads its guards on every render, and the
 * tests flip a mutable flag mock between cases in one module instance.
