/**
 * Feature flags service module
 *
 * This module provides methods for checking feature flags
 * defined in the environment variables. All feature flag environment
 * variables should be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_
 *
 * Rules:
 * 1. All feature flags must be defined in this file for easy maintenance
 * 2. Boolean flags must start with NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_ prefix
 * 3. Boolean flags use opt-in semantics (=== "true") and default to false
 * 4. Feature flags are only configurable by DevOps in mainnet environments
 * 5. Non-boolean gating config (e.g. wallet opt-in lists) may use other prefixes

   * (repay, withdraw, liquidation, activation stay available); gating the
   * remaining new-entry action (reorder) is the Freeze follow-up.

   * exposes it and emits Frozen/Paused events), but we intentionally drive the
   * banner from an operator flag for now — reading it on-chain is the follow-up.

   * different device app and a different transport stack from the legacy
   * `ledger_btc` / `ledger_btc_v2` staking adapters.
   * Why needed: the provider is built ahead of Ledger's firmware being final,
   * AND signing is not implemented yet (signPsbt/signPsbts/signMessage throw),

   * while the user is on another tab.

   * Why needed: the page lists a hand-authored set of partner apps
   * (config/exploreApps.ts) rather than data from a source we can point at, so

   * enforces on-chain.
   * Why needed: the parameter does not exist on every deployment yet (devnet
   * has it, testnet and staging do not). The gate fails CLOSED — an unreadable
   * delay must not let the HTLC secret reach `simulateContract` calldata — so
   * enabling it where the getter is absent would disable Activate for
   * everyone. DevOps flips it per environment once the contract exposes the

   * - deposit-disabled active (no pause/freeze) → replaces the deposit-disabled
   *   banner text.
   * - nothing active → renders as a standalone notice at the top of the app
   *   (e.g. intermittent peg-in errors while deposits remain enabled).
   * Why needed: Lets DevOps surface an ad-hoc message via env var without a
   * code change, and avoids the earlier two-flag confusion (a separate
   * status-only override that silently did nothing with DISABLE_DEPOSIT).

   * demo deposit into the real Pending/Expired Deposits section so every card
   * state (CTA shown / hidden, badges, steps) can be reviewed without
   * reproducing the on-chain conditions.
   * Why needed: Dev/QA tool; kept fully out of users' view.
   * Hard-gated on `import.meta.env.DEV`, so it can ONLY be enabled in a dev
   * build — a production build forces it false at compile time (and lets the
   * bundler drop the god-mode code; see demoDeposit.ts / DashboardPage.tsx).

   * Valid ids: unisat, onekey, okx, keystone, utila
   * (see packages/babylon-wallet-connector btc wallets).
   * Why needed: Lets DevOps hide a wallet per environment without a code change —
   * both to keep experimental/not-yet-ready wallets (onekey, utila) out of an
   * environment and to pull a wallet fast if its signing behavior regresses.
