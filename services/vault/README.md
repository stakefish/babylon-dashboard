# Babylon Vault

The Babylon Vault is a web application for managing Bitcoin-collateralized lending positions. Users can deposit BTC as collateral and borrow stablecoins against it.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (v8 or higher)

## Local Development

### 1. Install Dependencies

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `services/vault` directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with the required environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below).

### 3. Run Development Server

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm --filter @services/vault dev
```

Or from the `services/vault` directory:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

### Required

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BTC_NETWORK` - Bitcoin network (must be `mainnet` or `signet`)
  - Use `signet` for devnet/testnet
  - Use `mainnet` for production
  - Example: `signet`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ETH_CHAINID` - Ethereum chain ID (must be `1` or `11155111`)
  - Use `11155111` (Sepolia) for devnet/testnet
  - Use `1` (Ethereum Mainnet) for production
  - Example: `11155111`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TBV_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` - GraphQL API endpoint for vault data (also provides vault provider RPC URLs)
  - Example: `https://babylon-vault-indexer-api.vault-devnet.babylonlabs.io`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TBV_BTC_VAULT_REGISTRY` - TBV BTC Vault Registry contract address
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TBV_AAVE_ADAPTER` - TBV Aave Integration Adapter contract address

### Optional

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEMPOOL_API` - Mempool.space host for Bitcoin node queries
  - Default: `https://mempool.space` (mainnet) or `https://mempool.space/signet` (signet)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ETH_RPC_URL` - Custom Ethereum RPC URL
  - Default: `https://cloudflare-eth.com` (mainnet) or `https://rpc.sepolia.org` (sepolia)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMIT_HASH` - Git commit hash (usually injected during CI)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CANONICAL` - Canonical URL for the application

### Feature Flags

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_DISABLE_DEPOSIT` - Kill-switch to disable deposit functionality during maintenance or incidents
  - Default: `false` (deposits are enabled unless explicitly set to `"true"`)
  - Set to `"true"` to disable deposit functionality
  - When disabled, users will see "Depositing Unavailable" and the deposit button will be disabled

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_DISABLE_BORROW` - Kill-switch to disable borrowing functionality during maintenance or incidents
  - Default: `false` (borrowing is enabled unless explicitly set to `"true"`)
  - Set to `"true"` to disable borrowing functionality
  - When disabled, users will see "Borrowing Unavailable" and the borrow button will be disabled

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_FORCE_PARTIAL_LIQUIDATION_SPLIT` - Forces partial liquidation split to always be suggested, even with active vaults
  - Default: `false` (disabled unless explicitly set to `"true"`)
  - Set to `"true"` to bypass the active-vaults check — useful for dev/QA testing of the split deposit flow

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_PROTOCOL_FROZEN` - Shows the teal "Protocol is frozen" banner and disables new deposits and borrows (Freeze blocks new entry; exits like repay/withdraw/liquidation stay available)
  - Default: `false` (banner hidden unless explicitly set to `"true"`)
  - Operator-controlled; the banner reflects the flag (the on-chain Frozen/Paused state exists but isn't read yet)

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_PROTOCOL_PAUSED` - Shows the red "Protocol is paused" banner (the full stop; last-resort emergency)
  - Default: `false` (banner hidden unless explicitly set to `"true"`)
  - Takes precedence over `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_PROTOCOL_FROZEN` when both are set

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_ENABLE_EXPLORE` - Shows the Explore section: the `/explore` page and its sidebar entry
  - Default: `false` (the route redirects to `/` and the nav item is hidden unless explicitly set to `"true"`)
  - Off until the partner list is backed by the contributor registry rather than a hand-authored seed list

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_ENABLE_ACTIVATION_DELAY` - Holds Activate closed until the on-chain peg-in activation window has elapsed (`verifiedAt + peginActivationDelay`)
  - Default: `false` (no floor gate, and no contract read is issued at all)
  - Only the mint path is gated; "Activate and redeem" stays available during the window, matching the contract's own exemption
  - Enable per environment only once its `ProtocolParams` exposes `peginActivationDelay()` — verify with `cast call <protocolParams> "peginActivationDelay()(uint256)"`. The gate fails closed, so enabling it where the getter is absent disables Activate for everyone

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NOTICE_BANNER_MESSAGE` - The single operator message shown to depositors, placed by context (non-boolean config)
  - Default: empty (the default per-context copy is shown; standalone notice hidden)
  - When set: fills the frozen/paused status-card body if a status is active, else fills the deposit-disabled banner text if deposits are off, else shows as a standalone top-of-app notice

## Available Scripts

## Deployment

The application is built using Vite and can be deployed to any static hosting service:

```bash
pnpm build
# Output will be in dist/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

If port 5173 is already in use, you can specify a different port:

```bash
pnpm dev -- --port 3001
```

### Build memory issues

The build uses increased memory allocation. If you encounter memory issues, adjust `NODE_OPTIONS`:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=16384 pnpm build
```
