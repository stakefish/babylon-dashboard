/**
 * Photographs every screen in the capture manifest.
 *
 * This spec asserts nothing about how the app *looks* - that judgement
 * belongs to the diff step, which compares this run's output against the
 * same capture taken at the PR's merge-base. All this file guarantees is
 * that each screen renders real content, settles, and is written to disk
 * under a stable filename.
 *
 * Run it twice on the same commit and the two output directories must be
 * byte-identical. If they are not, the fix belongs in `stabilize.ts`, not
 * in a diff threshold.
 *
 * The backend behind these screens is a recorded devnet run, replayed from
 * the fixture in `e2e/fixtures/replay`. Before that, the VP proxy and the
 * contract reads were left unmocked and every page here rendered the app's
 * error boundary instead.
