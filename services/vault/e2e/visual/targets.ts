/**
 * The capture manifest: which screens get photographed, at which sizes.
 *
 * Kept as data (not inline in the spec) because the CI job reports on
 * target names, and because adding a screen should be a one-line change
 * that needs no Playwright knowledge.
 *
 * Every target here must render without a connected wallet. The e2e
 * harness installs a wallet *sentinel* only (see `fixtures/test.ts`);
 * page-side provider construction is #1592, so connected-state screens
 * are not reachable yet and are deliberately absent.
 *
 * Paths are written out rather than imported from `src/routes.ts` for
 * two reasons. Importing app source pulls `tokenService` -> the network
 * config singleton into the Playwright runner, which throws before any
 * test is collected. And a literal path is the behaviour we want: if a
 * route is renamed, this manifest should report the old screen as
 * removed and the new one as added, not silently follow the rename and
 * claim nothing changed.
