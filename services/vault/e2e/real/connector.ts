/**
 * Single bridge to the wallet-connector E2E harness.
 *
 * Those files are test-only and NOT exposed in the connector package's `exports`, so we import them by
 * relative path (resolved by tsx, which handles extensionless cross-package .ts imports). Keeping every
 * cross-package path here means a move only touches this one file. Run via `pnpm exec tsx` — see the
 * `e2e:cli` script.
