                  The first number is the {coinSymbol} Staking APR if you only

                  Annual Percentage Reward (APR) is a dynamic estimate of the
                  annualized staking reward rate based on current network
                  conditions, and it refers to staking rewards rather than
                  traditional lending interest. Rewards are distributed in BABY
                  tokens but shown as a Bitcoin-equivalent rate relative to the
                  Bitcoin initially staked. APR is calculated using U.S. dollar
                  values for Bitcoin and BABY from independent, reputable
                  sources. The APR shown is an approximate figure that can
                  fluctuate, and the displayed value may not always be
                  completely accurate. Actual rewards are not guaranteed and may
                  vary over time. Staking carries exposure to slashing and other
                  risks.
