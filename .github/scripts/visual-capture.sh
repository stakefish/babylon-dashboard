# --- Storybook (components) -------------------------------------------------
# The broadest and cheapest surface: every story renders in isolation with no
# backend, no wallet and no network. Built static rather than served by
# `storybook dev` so there is no HMR client injecting itself into the frame.
# Binaries are invoked directly rather than through the `visual:*` package
# scripts. Those scripts are added by the PR that introduces this harness, so
# they do not exist at the merge-base and the baseline side would die with
# ERR_PNPM_NO_SCRIPT. Calling the binary makes this script independent of the
# checked-out commit's package.json.

# --- Vault app (pages) ------------------------------------------------------
# The vault dev server resolves @babylonlabs-io/core-ui (and ts-sdk,
# wallet-connector) through their package `exports` to `dist/`, which is
# gitignored and therefore ABSENT on a fresh runner. Without this build the
# dev server cannot resolve them and every page captures as a blank frame -
# it only appears to work on a developer machine that has built before.
