## Overview

Babylon's Trustless Bitcoin Vaults (TBV) let users lock
BTC on Bitcoin and receive vaultBTC on Ethereum for use
as DeFi collateral. The user locks BTC into a Taproot
script-path output, registers the vault on Ethereum, and
later activates the vault by revealing a hashlock secret
to mint the matching vaultBTC.

This guide is for **BTC wallet vendors** integrating with
TBV. The Ethereum side is hands-off — see
[Ethereum Wallet](#ethereum-wallet).

Status: pre-mainnet. Some details (notably
`deriveContextHash`) may evolve before launch.

## Capability Matrix

**MUST** = deposits fail without it. **STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED** = deposits work, UX degrades. **OPTIONAL** =
nice-to-have.

| Capability | Requirement | Why / where enforced |
|---|---|---|
| BIP-340 Schnorr + BIP-341 Taproot script-path spends with untweaked key | MUST | Vault HTLC scripts use Taproot script-path; SDK passes `useTweakedSigner: false` ([`signing.ts`][signing]) |
| 64-byte Schnorr signatures (implicit `SIGHASH_DEFAULT`) | MUST | SDK rejects 65-byte sigs; the appended sighash byte changes the signed message and cannot be stripped ([`peginInput.ts`][peginInput], [`payout.ts`][payout]) |
| Non-finalized PSBT return for PegIn input PSBTs | MUST | SDK extracts the depositor signature from `tapScriptSig`; finalized PegIn PSBTs throw outright ([`peginInput.ts`][peginInput]) |
| BIP-322 simple message signing | MUST | Used for proof-of-possession ([`PeginManager.ts`][peginManager]) |
| `deriveContextHash` (HKDF-SHA-256, BIP-32 hardened path `m/73681862'`) | MUST | Vault secret derivation (hashlock secrets, WOTS seeds, auth anchor) — see [deriveContextHash](#derivecontexthash) for the algorithm and [the conformance vectors][vectors] |
| `signPsbts` (batch signing) | STRONGLY RECOMMENDED | Without it, depositors approve N PSBTs one-by-one |
| `getInscriptions` | OPTIONAL | UTXO filtering only |

## For Wallets Already Supporting BTC Staking

*Skip this section if your wallet has not previously
integrated Babylon BTC staking.*

If your wallet already implements `IBTCProvider` for
Babylon BTC staking, here's what's new for TBV:

| Aspect | TBV Vault | BTC Staking |
|---|---|---|
| BTC wallet | `IBTCProvider` | Same |
| ETH wallet | **Required** — via WalletConnect (no work for the BTC wallet team) | N/A |
| Batch signing | Critical — multiple PSBTs per deposit + payout pre-signing | Delegation only |
| Message signing | `"bip322-simple"` for PoP | Same |
| Taproot path | `useTweakedSigner: false` (untweaked key) | Same |
| Schnorr signature size | **Strictly 64 bytes — no sighash byte** | Either accepted |
| Vault secret derivation | `deriveContextHash` — new requirement | N/A |
| Chains | **Dual**: BTC + ETH | BTC + Cosmos |

## Vault Deposit Flow

From the BTC wallet's perspective, a deposit triggers
these signing prompts in order. Steps interleaved between
these are Ethereum transactions handled by the user's ETH
wallet — not this wallet's concern.

1. **Derive vault root** — `deriveContextHash("babylon-btc-vault", context)`, once per deposit batch (regardless of vault count). The SDK expands per-vault secrets locally from this root.
2. **Sign Proof-of-Possession** — `signMessage(message, "bip322-simple")`, once per deposit session.
3. **Batch-sign PegIn input PSBTs** — `signPsbts(psbtsHexes, options)` (Taproot script-path, untweaked, non-finalized). Falls back to sequential `signPsbt()` if batch unavailable.
4. **Sign Pre-PegIn funding transaction** — `signPsbt(psbtHex)` after Ethereum registration succeeds. Standard funding-input signing across whatever UTXO types the wallet contributes.
5. **Sign payout transactions** — `signPsbts(psbtsHexes, options)`. Multiple PSBTs per vault: claimer payout, no-payout, challenge-assert, and depositor-graph.

## Bitcoin Wallet Interface

TBV uses the `IBTCProvider` interface from
`@babylonlabs-io/wallet-connector`. Full type definitions
are in [`src/core/types.ts`](../src/core/types.ts).

| Method | Signature | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `connectWallet` | `() => Promise<void>` | Connect to the wallet |
| `getAddress` | `() => Promise<string>` | Get BTC address. The depositor identity for vault deposits is a Taproot account (P2TR `bc1p…` / `tb1p…`). |
| `getPublicKeyHex` | `() => Promise<string>` | Get public key hex. Taproot: x-only (32 bytes, 64 hex, no `0x`). Compressed (33 bytes) also accepted — SDK strips first byte. |
| `signPsbt` | `(psbtHex: string, options?: SignPsbtOptions) => Promise<string>` | Sign a single PSBT. See [SignPsbtOptions](#signpsbtoptions). |
| `signPsbts` | `(psbtsHexes: string[], options?: SignPsbtOptions[]) => Promise<string[]>` | Batch sign PSBTs in one prompt. Falls back to sequential `signPsbt()` if unavailable. |
| `signMessage` | `(message: string, type: "bip322-simple" \| "ecdsa") => Promise<string>` | Sign a message. TBV uses `"bip322-simple"` for PoP. See [PoP message format](#pop-message-format). |
| `deriveContextHash` | `(appName: string, context: string) => Promise<string>` | Derive 32-byte value via HKDF-SHA-256. See [deriveContextHash](#derivecontexthash) and [the conformance vectors][vectors]. |
| `getNetwork` | `() => Promise<Network>` | Get BTC network. Wallet must operate on the network the dApp is configured for (signet vs mainnet); mismatch must error. |
| `on` / `off` | `(eventName: string, cb: () => void) => void` | Register/unregister event listener |
| `getInscriptions` | `() => Promise<InscriptionIdentifier[]>` | Optional. UTXO filtering. |
| `cancelSigning` | `() => void` | Optional. Requests cancellation of the in-flight ceremony; settles at the next device exchange. Feature-detect. |
| `subscribeSigningProgress` | `(listener: (p: SigningProgress) => void) => () => void` | Optional. Per-PSBT ticks inside `signPsbts` for providers that run one device ceremony per PSBT. Fires after each committed ceremony; a failed ceremony emits no tick and earlier ticks stand. Feature-detect; returns the unsubscribe. Outlives the batch; dropped on session teardown. Listener is sync; an overlapping `signPsbts` is rejected, never queued; never fires for `signPsbt`. |

### SignPsbtOptions

```ts
interface SignPsbtOptions {
  autoFinalized?: boolean;
  signInputs?: SignInputOptions[];
}

interface SignInputOptions {
  index: number;
  address?: string;
  publicKey?: string;
  sighashTypes?: number[];
  useTweakedSigner?: boolean;
}
```

For vault Taproot script-path PSBTs, the SDK always
passes `autoFinalized: false` and `useTweakedSigner:
false` ([`signing.ts`][signing]). Wallets MUST honor
both: return a non-finalized PSBT with `tapScriptSig`
entries, signed with the **untweaked internal key**.
Auto-finalizing PegIn input PSBTs causes the SDK to
throw — the depositor signature cannot be reliably
extracted from the witness stack.

### deriveContextHash

```ts
deriveContextHash(
  appName: string,
  context: string
): Promise<string>
```

TBV uses `deriveContextHash("babylon-btc-vault", context)` to
get one 32-byte root per deposit batch (one Pre-PegIn). The SDK expands the root
into each vault's hashlock secret, WOTS seed and the shared
auth anchor ([spec][secrets-spec]). The SHA-256 of each
hashlock secret is committed in its HTLC during vault
creation, and the secret is revealed during activation.

Implementation requirements (the [spec][spec] has the full
algorithm and rationale; the [conformance vectors][vectors]
pin the exact bytes):

- BIP-32 hardened derivation path `m/73681862'`.
- `ikm` is the raw 32-byte big-endian private-key scalar at that path (no
  chain code, no serialization prefix), the same for every account and
  network. An invalid BIP-32 child at that index is an error; do not skip
  to the next index. Never use the path for signing or any other
  derivation.
- HKDF-SHA-256 with `salt` = UTF-8 `"derive-context-hash"`, `info` =
  `SHA-256(UTF8(appName)) || SHA-256(UTF8(canonicalNetworkName)) ||
  connectedPubkey (33-byte compressed SEC1) || context bytes`, output
  length 32.
- `canonicalNetworkName` is one of `bitcoin-mainnet`, `bitcoin-testnet`
  (testnet3 and testnet4), `bitcoin-signet`, `bitcoin-regtest`. Any other
  network must fail with a distinct "unsupported network" error, not
  "method not supported".
- `connectedPubkey` is the 33-byte compressed SEC1 form of the key the
  wallet returned to the dApp as the active connected key for this request.
  A wallet with several accounts binds the key of the account selected when
  `deriveContextHash` is called.
  The `m/44'/0'/0'/0/0` leaf in the conformance vector is a fixture only.
- Imported (non-HD) keys use the raw 32-byte private key as `ikm`. MPC and
  other non-HD wallets may use their own deterministic derivation: 32-byte
  output, dependent on the key material and on all four of `appName`,
  `canonicalNetworkName`, `connectedPubkey` and `context`, stable across
  share refreshes that keep the same public key. Neither is portable to an
  HD wallet restored from the same phrase; document this to users and
  application developers.
- 32-byte output (64 lowercase hex chars).
- `appName` must match `[a-z0-9\-]`, 1–64 bytes.
- `context` must be lowercase hex, even-length, non-empty, no `0x` prefix, max 1024 bytes.
- Wallet MUST require user approval and display `appName` ("babylon-btc-vault"). It MUST also display the requesting origin when the transport carries one (browser extensions, injected providers). Hardware wallets reached over raw APDU, USB, BLE or QR have no authenticated origin and MUST NOT present a dApp-supplied string as a verified one.

### PoP Message Format

The exact string signed in step 2 of the deposit flow:

```
${depositorEthAddress.toLowerCase()}:${ethChainId}:pegin:${btcVaultRegistryAddress.toLowerCase()}
```

Concrete example (sepolia, chain ID `11155111`):

```
0xabcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01:11155111:pegin:0x123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef012345678
```

Source: [`PeginManager.ts`][peginManager]. Wallet UI
should render this as readable text (lowercase Ethereum
address, decimal chain ID, the literal token `pegin`,
lowercase contract address) rather than raw bytes.

[peginManager]: ../../babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/managers/PeginManager.ts

## Common Incompatibilities

These are the patterns most likely to break a new
integration. Each fails-closed in the SDK rather than
silently producing wrong output.

- **Auto-finalizing PegIn input PSBTs.** Must return non-finalized with `tapScriptSig`. Finalized PSBTs throw at extraction.
- **65-byte Schnorr signatures** (with `SIGHASH_ALL` `0x01` appended). Must be exactly 64 bytes (implicit `SIGHASH_DEFAULT`). Rejected by the SDK rather than stripped.
- **Tweaked-only Taproot signing.** Vault PSBTs are Taproot script-path spends and need the untweaked internal key. Honor `useTweakedSigner: false`.
- **No `deriveContextHash` support.** Hashlock derivation is mandatory; the deposit cannot proceed without it.
- **Mutating Pre-PegIn outputs.** The Pre-PegIn includes a 32-byte OP_RETURN at `vout = vaultCount` (exact 34-byte script). Wallets MUST NOT reorder outputs, strip/modify the OP_RETURN, change the fee, or add anti-fee-sniping `nLocktime` tweaks.
- **Network mismatch.** Wallet must operate on the network the dApp is configured for (signet for testnet, mainnet for prod). Silent address-type swaps must error.
- **No batch `signPsbts`.** Not a hard incompatibility, but UX degrades to N popups per deposit + payout-presigning round.
- **Address-type drift on reconnect.** Returning P2WPKH after a Taproot address was used earlier in the session breaks the deposit. The wallet must keep the depositor identity stable for the session.
- **PSBT version mismatch.** The SDK passes BIP-174 PSBTv0; wallets that only accept v2 will fail.

Conformance test vectors for `deriveContextHash` and the
exact wire format are pinned in [the conformance test][vectors].

## Hardware Wallets

Hardware wallet support is preliminary. Stock Bitcoin apps
on Ledger and Trezor do not expose `deriveContextHash`
(custom HKDF beyond BIP-32), have limited BIP-322
support, and have small-screen constraints that make
batch payout signing impractical. Vendors with HW
interest should plan for either a dedicated Babylon Vault
app or a custom HKDF derivation extension to the stock
Bitcoin app, plus full conformance against the pinned test
vectors and a mainnet/signet deposit-flow run before
advertising support.

## Ethereum Wallet

Babylon handles the Ethereum side via AppKit /
WalletConnect. BTC wallet vendors do not need a custom
ETH adapter — any wallet listed in WalletConnect with
standard EIP-1193 transaction signing works out of the
box.
