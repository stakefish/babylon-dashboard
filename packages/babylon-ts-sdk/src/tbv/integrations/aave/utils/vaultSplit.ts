 * Vault Split Utilities for Aave Liquidation Protection
 *

 * vault per call, taking the head of the borrower's ordered vault list.
 * Splitting a deposit into 2 vaults (sacrificial + protected) lets a
 * liquidation take the small head vault and leave the rest of the position.
 *
 * The sacrificial vault (index 0) is sized so that seizing it at the expected
 * liquidation health factor lifts the position back to the split target
 * health factor. The protected vault (index 1) holds the remainder.
 *
 * Seizure formula:
 * ```
 * liq_penalty = LB × CF
 * debt_to_repay = total_debt × (THF - current_HF) / (THF - liq_penalty)
 * target_seizure = debt_to_repay × LB
 * ```
