/**
 * Reclaim orchestration — sweep the depositor-claim reserve (PegIn vout 1)
 * back to the depositor after their vault has terminally settled.
 *
 * The SDK owns the sequence: read → vault-id bind → fee caps → PSBT build →
 * sign → verify → finalize → broadcast. Interactive transports (`signPsbt`,
 * `broadcastTx`) and the data read stay as injected callbacks, so the caller
 * keeps its transport choice and error decoding. Mirrors
 * `services/refund/buildAndBroadcastRefund`.
 *
 * > **Eligibility is the caller's job, and it is a safety control.** The claim
 * > leaf carries no timelock, so this service will sweep a reserve whose vault
 * > is still live. Doing that permanently voids the depositor's pre-signed
 * > recourse graph: their `claim_tx` hard-codes `OutPoint(peginTxid, 1)` as its
 * > only input, and every downstream Assert / Payout / NoPayout signature
 * > commits to that tx's txid. There is no re-funding path. The caller must
 * > confirm the vault's Payout has landed — PegIn vout 0 spent and deeply
 * > confirmed — before calling this.
