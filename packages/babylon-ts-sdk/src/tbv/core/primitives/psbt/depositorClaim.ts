/**
 * Depositor-claim output descriptor
 *
 * The PegIn transaction's vout 1 carries `depositorClaimValue` — the reserve
 * that funds the depositor's own `claim_tx`, their recourse if the vault
 * provider fails during peg-out.
 *
 * It is btc-vault's `SingleKeyConnector` (`crates/vault/src/connectors/mod.rs`):
 * a Taproot output with the NUMS internal key (key path provably unspendable)
 * and exactly one tapleaf at depth 0, `<depositor> OP_CHECKSIG`. No timelock,
 * no counterparty key — the depositor's Schnorr signature alone spends it.
 *
 * Two call sites need this, and they must not drift:
 *  - `assertPeginTxShape` (./pegin) validates the encoded PegIn output against
 *    the scriptPubKey before the depositor signs the peg-in.
 *  - `buildReclaimPsbt` (./reclaim) spends that same output, and needs the leaf
 *    script and control block to populate the PSBT's `tapLeafScript`.
 *
 * Keeping one definition here is what makes the reclaim's script binding
 * meaningful: the bytes the reclaim signs against are the same bytes the
 * peg-in validated.
