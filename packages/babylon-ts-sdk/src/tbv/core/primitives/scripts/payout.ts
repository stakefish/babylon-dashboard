/**
 * Payout Script Generator Primitive
 *
 * This module provides pure functions for generating payout scripts and taproot information
 * by wrapping the WASM implementation from @babylonlabs-io/babylon-tbv-rust-wasm.
 *
 * The payout script is used for signing payout transactions in the vault system.
 * It defines the spending conditions for the vault output, enabling the depositor
 * to authorize payouts during the peg-in flow (Step 3).
 *
 * @remarks
 * This is a low-level primitive. For most use cases, prefer using {@link buildPayoutPsbt}
 * which handles script creation internally. For high-level wallet orchestration, use
 * PayoutManager from the managers module.
 *
 * @see {@link buildPayoutPsbt} - Higher-level function that uses this internally
 *
 * @module primitives/scripts/payout
