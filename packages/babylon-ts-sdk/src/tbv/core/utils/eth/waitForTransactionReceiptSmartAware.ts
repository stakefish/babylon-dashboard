/**
 * Smart-account-aware wrapper around viem's `waitForTransactionReceipt`.
 *
 * Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) — wallets controlled by a single private
 * key, e.g. MetaMask or a hardware wallet. `eth_sendTransaction` returns a real
 * Ethereum tx hash, which viem can poll directly. This wrapper delegates
 * unchanged for them.
 *
 * Smart-contract accounts (e.g. Safe multisigs) — the wallet address is a
 * deployed contract that decides whether to accept a transaction. WalletConnect's
 * `eth_sendTransaction` returns a `safeTxHash` (an EIP-712 hash of the
 * *proposal*) rather than a real tx hash, and the proposal is held in Safe's
 * off-chain Transaction Service until quorum signs and executes it. We poll
 * that service for the proposal until execution, then wait for receipt on the
 * real Ethereum tx hash exposed in the service's response.
 *
 * The two are told apart by `eth_getCode`, but NOT by "empty vs non-empty":
 * an EIP-7702 delegated EOA reports `0xef0100 ‖ <delegate address>` and is
 * still an EOA — it signs and submits its own transactions, so
 * `eth_sendTransaction` returns a real tx hash. MetaMask upgrades accounts to
 * smart accounts this way by default, and treating one as a Safe means polling
 * the Transaction Service for a hash that is not a `safeTxHash`: a permanent
 * 404 that reads as "proposal not yet indexed" and hangs for the full poll
 * budget on a transaction that already succeeded. Delegation designators are
 * therefore classified as EOAs. As a backstop for any wallet that behaves this
 * way in future, a 404 from the Transaction Service is also checked against the
 * node: if it knows the hash as a real transaction, we were never waiting on a
 * proposal and switch to waiting for that transaction's receipt.
