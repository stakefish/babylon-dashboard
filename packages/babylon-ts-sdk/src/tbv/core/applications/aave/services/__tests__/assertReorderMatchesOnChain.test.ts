/**
 * Tests for the reorder integrity guards.
 *
 * Guard A — `assertReorderMembership`: blocks submissions where the
 * indexer-supplied vault set diverges from the user's on-chain position.
 * Returns the current on-chain ordering so Guard B can feed it into the
 * calculator.
 *
 * Guard B — `assertSuggestedOrderMatchesOnChain`: re-runs the full
 * notification calculator with on-chain amounts and blocks submissions
 * whose ordering disagrees (the same-set tamper attack), whose vaults
 * are inactive or bound to a different application, or whose trusted
 * calculator would not have suggested a reorder at all (rebalance
 * suppression).
