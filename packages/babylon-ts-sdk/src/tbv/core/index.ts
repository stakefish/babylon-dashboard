/**
 * Core Vault Protocol Functionality
 *
 * This module contains:
 * - Primitives (Level 1): Pure functions wrapping WASM
 * - Utils (Level 2): UTXO selection, transaction funding, fee calculation
 * - Managers (Level 2): Wallet orchestration
 * - Clients: API clients (mempool, vault provider)
 * - Contracts: Smart contract ABIs
 * - Services: Deposit validation, peg-in protocol state, pegout state
 * - WOTS: Winternitz one-time signature utilities
 * - Vault Secrets: HKDF-Expand pipeline producing hashlock / auth-anchor /
 *   wots-seed from an opaque 32-byte root.
 * - Peg-in Fingerprint: the commitment over the protocol state a Pre-PegIn was
 *   built against, which the registry re-checks when the request is included.
 * - Recovery: reconstruction of a Pre-PegIn whose Ethereum registration was
 *   lost to a reorg, from the wallet and the transaction alone.
