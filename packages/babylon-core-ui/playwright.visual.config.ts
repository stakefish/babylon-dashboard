 * so there is almost nothing left to be non-deterministic. Contrast the
 * vault app capture, which needs a mocked backend to reach even its
 * unconnected state.
 *
 * Captures against a **pre-built static Storybook**, not `storybook dev`.
 * The build is ~11s and the static server has no HMR client injecting
 * itself into the frame, which removes a whole class of jitter.
