/**
 * Photographs every Storybook story.
 *
 * The story list is read from the built Storybook's `index.json` at run
 * time rather than hard-coded, so adding a story automatically adds
 * visual coverage and deleting one shows up in the diff report as a
 * removed screen. Nothing to maintain by hand.
 *
 * Docs entries (`type: "docs"`) are skipped: an MDX page is prose about
 * the components, and it re-renders every story inside it, so capturing
 * it would double the cost and report one change as many.
 *
 * Like the vault capture, this asserts nothing about how a story looks.
 * The judgement happens in the diff step against the same capture taken
 * at the PR's merge-base.
