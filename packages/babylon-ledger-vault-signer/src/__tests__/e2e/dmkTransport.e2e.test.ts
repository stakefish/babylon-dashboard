/**
 * DMK-transport end-to-end test: the production {@link connectDmkSession} path
 * — discovery, connect with the refresher disabled, and the
 * GET_APP_AND_VERSION preflight — driven over a REAL DMK transport instead of
 * the unit suite's mocked one. The sibling `speculos.e2e.test.ts` speaks to
 * Speculos over its REST API directly and never exercises DMK; this file is
 * the only coverage of the transport seam actually carrying APDUs.
 *
 * Runs against the same container as that suite, and is skipped unless
 * SPECULOS_URL is set (SPECULOS_REQUIRED turns that skip into a failure — CI):
 *
 *   SPECULOS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5055 pnpm exec vitest run src/__tests__/e2e/
 *
 * That container is a single device holding one ceremony session, so this file
 * must never run alongside `speculos.e2e.test.ts` — vitest.config.ts drops
 * `fileParallelism` whenever SPECULOS_URL is set, which is what keeps them apart.
 *
 * @module ledger-vault-signer/__tests__/e2e/dmkTransport.e2e.test
