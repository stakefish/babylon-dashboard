# Contributing

bbn-toolkit repository follows the same contributing rules as
[Babylon node](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
repository.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 24.2.0 - see `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm (managed via Corepack)

### Setup

1. **Enable Corepack** (if using Node.js 24 or earlier, Corepack is bundled):
   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

2. **For Node.js 25+** (Corepack is not bundled), install it first:
   ```bash
   npm install -g corepack
   corepack enable
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (must be run from the workspace root):
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

**Important:** Always run `pnpm install` from the workspace root, not from individual package directories. The project will automatically enforce this.

### Build

To build the whole repository, run:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Linting

To run the linter, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

### Testing

To run tests for all packages:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

## Use nx command to learn the project dependency graph and available commands

```bash
pnpm exec nx graph
```

## Running build of a specific package

To build a specific package, use the following command:
```bash
pnpm exec nx build @babylonlabs-io/core-ui
```

Similarly, you can run tests or lint for a specific package:

```bash
pnpm exec nx test @babylonlabs-io/core-ui
pnpm exec nx lint @babylonlabs-io/core-ui
```

## Release

We use conventional commits to manage releases. To make sure a release happens, you need to follow the commit message format. For more information, refer to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

Note: When we squash commits on Github, there is no way for us to validate the commit message. So please make sure you follow the commit message format before you squash and merge commits.

### Release tag for new package

In order to release a new package or migrated package, a release tag will need to be added and pushed to remote so that the release process can figure out the next version to release.
This is only a one time setup for each newly added package. Release process will continue creating new release tags after that.

For a new package, do
```
git tag @babylonlabs-io/my-package/0.0.1
git push origin @babylonlabs-io/my-package/0.0.1
```

For a migrated package, make sure the tag version matches the released version in NPM
```
git tag @babylonlabs-io/my-package/1.2.3
git push origin @babylonlabs-io/my-package/1.2.3
```

The tag version itself is never published - nx only rolls forward from it, so the `0.0.1` above stays a version that exists in git and not on NPM. Push the tag before the package's own code lands, so the commit that adds the package is a conventional commit nx can bump from.

Nothing may depend on the new package until it has published at least once. The release refuses to pin a version that is not on the registry:

```text
@babylonlabs-io/my-package is pinned at 0.0.1 but has never been published.
Publish it before publishing anything that depends on it.
```

If you hit that after the fact, land a `feat:` or `fix:` commit touching the new package so it publishes in its own right. Do not delete or move the tag.

### When a release fails

The release stops rather than publish a manifest a consumer cannot install. Nothing is tagged unless every package published.

| Message | What happened | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| `is pinned at X but has never been published` | A dependency has a release tag and nothing on NPM | Publish it first - see above |
| `is pinned by this release but does not exist on the registry` | Its tag exists without a matching publish, so an earlier release failed or was skipped | Bump it in this release, or publish that version by hand |
| `resolved to version X, which has no release tag` | nx fell back to the version in `packages/*/package.json`, which is not a released version | Tag the version that is on NPM, on the commit that produced it. Tagging `HEAD` instead swallows every unreleased change before it |
| `is not part of this release run and has no stable release tag` | A dependency nx filtered out of the run has never been released - most likely on an RC dispatch, which versions one project | Release it on `main` first |
| `whose latest release tag reads "X" - not an exact version` | Its newest stable tag does not parse as an exact version - a leading `v`, a partial version, or a range | Retag it with a bare `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` matching what is on NPM |
| `depends on the private workspace package` | A published package depends on one nx never publishes | Make it publishable, or drop the dependency |
| `are marked "private", so nx will version and tag them` | Same, for a package in the release set itself | Make it publishable, or move it out of `packages/`. Narrowing `release.projects` does not work - the driver only accepts `<directory>/*` entries |
| `cannot be published: its manifest would ship dependency versions a consumer cannot resolve` | A dependency spec the driver could not rewrite | Fix the spec in that package.json - syncpack pins local packages to `workspace:*` |
| `were versioned but did not publish` | The publish step failed part-way and no tags were created | Check which packages landed on NPM before re-running; a published version is immutable |
| `Tagging failed AFTER a successful publish` | Everything is on NPM but the tags are not in git | Create those tags by hand. Do not re-run the release |


### SDK Release Workflow

The `@babylonlabs-io/ts-sdk` and `@babylonlabs-io/babylon-tbv-rust-wasm` packages follow an independent release cycle, decoupled from the vault frontend.

#### How releases work

| Trigger | What happens | npm tag |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Push to `main` with conventional commit | CI auto-publishes next stable version (e.g., `0.2.0`) | `latest` |
| Manual workflow dispatch from a branch | Publishes a release candidate (e.g., `0.2.0-rc.0`) | `next` |

#### Stable releases (automatic)

Merging a PR to `main` that touches `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/` or `packages/babylon-tbv-rust-wasm/` with a conventional commit prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`) triggers the CI pipeline to publish a new stable version automatically.

#### Release candidates (manual)

Use RCs to test SDK changes against the vault frontend before merging to `main`:

1. Create a feature branch and make your SDK changes
2. Go to **Actions → "Build and Release in Mono Repo" → Run workflow**
3. Select the branch, package, and pre-release identifier (default: `rc`)
4. The RC is published to npm with the `next` tag (e.g., `0.2.0-rc.0`)
5. In the vault frontend, temporarily pin to the RC version to test:
   ```json
   "@babylonlabs-io/ts-sdk": "0.2.0-rc.0"
   ```
6. Run `pnpm install` and verify the integration
7. Once validated, merge the SDK branch to `main` → CI publishes stable `0.2.0`
8. Update vault to the stable version

#### Consuming SDK in the vault frontend

The vault frontend pins to a specific SDK version (not `workspace:*`). To upgrade:

1. Update the version in `services/vault/package.json`
2. Run `pnpm install` to update the lockfile
3. Test and submit a PR
