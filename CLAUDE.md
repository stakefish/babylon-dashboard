# CLAUDE.md — babylon-toolkit

## Project Overview

Monorepo (pnpm workspaces) for Babylon's Bitcoin vault frontend. Users lock BTC on Bitcoin, receive vaultBTC on Ethereum for DeFi collateral. The frontend manages the full depositor lifecycle: vault provider selection, deposit, presigning payout transactions, broadcasting, redemption.

### Key Packages

- `services/vault` — Main vault dApp (Next.js)
- `packages/babylon-tbv-rust-wasm` — Rust→WASM for transaction construction, fee calculation
- `packages/wallet-connector` — Multi-chain wallet abstraction (BTC + ETH)
- `packages/core-ui` — Shared UI component library
- `packages/ts-sdk` — TypeScript SDK for protocol interaction
- `packages/babylon-ledger-vault-signer` — Host-side client for the Ledger Babylon Vault app (device protocol only; wallet-connector adapts it)

### Build Prerequisites

- Node 24 via nvm (`nvm use 24`), pnpm via Corepack
- Must rebuild `core-ui` and `ts-sdk` before vault build, and `babylon-ledger-vault-signer` before wallet-connector tests (stale `dist/` is a common issue)

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
nvm use 24                            # Switch to Node 24 (required)
pnpm install                          # Install all dependencies
pnpm run build                        # Build all packages
pnpm run lint                         # Lint all packages
pnpm run test                         # Run all tests (vitest)
pnpm --filter vault run dev           # Dev server for vault service
```

Run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run test` in the affected service before considering work done.

## CRITICAL PATHS — HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED

These paths handle irreversible value movement. An AI-generated mistake here is silent: code compiles, tests pass, wrong BTC amount ships. **Any change touching these files requires two reviewers, and the author must be able to explain every changed line without an AI assistant open.**

### 1. WASM boundary (value computation)

- File: `packages/babylon-tbv-rust-wasm/src/index.ts`
- The Rust/WASM layer computes `htlcValue = peginAmount + depositorClaimValue + p2aAnchorValue + minPeginFee` internally (the anchor term is 0 for tx-graph v1, 240 sats for v2 and v3). JS receives outputs with no runtime validation.
- **Rule:** Every WASM output consumed by JS must be asserted against expected bounds before use. If a WASM-returned value feeds a signed transaction, cross-check it against an independently computed expected value.

### 2. Fee calculation consistency

- Files:
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/utils/utxo/selectUtxos.ts` — UTXO selection with iterative fee recalculation
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/utils/fee/peginFeeMath.ts` — shared Pre-PegIn vsize/fee model
  - `services/vault/src/hooks/deposit/useEstimatedBtcFee.ts` — dApp-side estimate (delegates to the SDK model)
- Both systems must agree before broadcast. A mismatch underfunds the transaction.
- **Rule:** When changing either, re-verify the other produces the same fee for a representative fixture. Cross-check assertions belong at the broadcast site, not only at the estimator.

### 3. Presigning depositor-graph transactions (Payout + NoPayout)

- Files:
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/primitives/psbt/payout.ts`
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/services/deposit/signDepositorGraph.ts` — orchestrator that derives `LocalChallengers`, asserts the VP-returned `challenger_presign_data` set equals `local ∪ universal`, and decides which per-challenger NoPayout PSBTs get pre-signed
  - `services/vault/src/hooks/deposit/depositFlowSteps/payoutSigning.ts`
- The depositor pre-signs payout (and per-challenger NoPayout) transactions built by the Vault Provider — values and challenger sets come from an external party with no independent verification. Asymmetric failure: undersigning leaves recovery material missing for an active challenger; oversigning hands signatures to a key the protocol doesn't recognize.
- **Rule:** Before the signature call, re-derive the expected payout amount from on-chain or WASM-computed sources and assert equality. For the challenger set, derive `LocalChallengers` from on-chain VK list (matching the Rust reference in `btc-vault crates/vault/src/tx_graph/graph.rs`) and assert the VP-returned set equals `local ∪ universal` exactly — no missing entries, no extras. Never sign a value or accept a challenger key handed to us verbatim.

### 4. Vault-secret derivation (frozen on-chain-binding API)

- Files (all marked `@stability frozen` in JSDoc):
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/vault-secrets/context.ts` — `buildVaultContext`, `buildFundingOutpointsCommitment`
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/vault-secrets/deriveVaultRoot.ts` — `deriveVaultRoot`, `VAULT_APP_NAME`
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/vault-secrets/index.ts` — re-exports `expandAuthAnchor`, `expandHashlockSecret`, `expandWotsSeed` from the WASM package
  - `packages/babylon-tbv-rust-wasm/src/index.ts` — browser-side async wrappers for the three expanders
  - `packages/babylon-tbv-rust-wasm/src/index-node.ts` — node-side async wrappers for the three expanders
  - `packages/babylon-tbv-rust-wasm/scripts/build-wasm.js` — `VAULT_WASM_COMMIT` pin (the vault-wasm facade at this commit, and the btc-vault revs it bundles, are the byte-level source of truth for the HKDF `info` encoding, labels, and i2osp prefixes)
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/wots/blockDerivation.ts` — `deriveWotsBlocksFromSeed`, `computeWotsBlockPublicKeysHash`
- The orchestrator that composes these primitives:
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/managers/PeginManager.ts` — `PeginManager.preparePegin` (sizing → `deriveVaultRoot` → per-vault expand → commit pass with `htlcVout === index` invariant). The wrapper API may evolve; the underlying frozen primitives must not.
- These functions feed `wallet.deriveContextHash` and produce on-chain commitments (`depositorWotsPkHash`, HTLC hashlock, OP_RETURN auth-anchor preimage). Any byte-level change to layout, ordering, label, or HKDF info rotates the secrets and **invalidates every existing deposit** — users cannot derive matching keys, cannot activate, cannot resume.
- **Rule:** Treat as a hard fork. Changes require: (a) a coordinated revision of `derive-vault-secrets.md` / `derive-context-hash.md`, (b) updated golden-vector tests in `btc-vault` (`golden_vectors_pinned`) and vault-wasm (`lib.rs`) — the byte-level `info` encoding lives Rust-side and those tests are the source of truth, plus the JS golden vectors in `vault-secrets/__tests__/expand.test.ts`, (c) a migration plan for in-flight deposits. A bump of `VAULT_WASM_COMMIT` in `build-wasm.js` that changes any expander output is equivalent to changing this list — re-run the JS golden-vector gate on every bump. Match the Rust `babe::wots` reference byte-for-byte. Two-vault test (overlapping inputs, distinct keys) is mandatory for any chain-logic change.

### 5. HTLC secret & vault activation

- File: `services/vault/src/services/vault/vaultActivationService.ts`
- Submits the secret that unlocks the HTLC on-chain. Wrong secret = funds permanently locked.
- **Rule:** Verify `hash(secret) === expectedHash` immediately before submission. Do not infer the secret from UI state - derive it only from the source that generated it.

### 6. Multi-vault split transactions

- File: `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/integrations/aave/utils/vaultSplit.ts`
- Split outputs must be sized exactly and broadcast in order. Incorrect sizing starves one vault or fails the whole deposit after commitment.
- **Rule:** Assert `sum(splitOutputs) === totalDeposit - fees` before signing. Assert broadcast ordering with explicit sequence checks, not array iteration order.

### 7. Ledger vault signer package

- Directory: `packages/babylon-ledger-vault-signer/src/`
- Host-side client for the Ledger vault app: APDU framing, the intent-ceremony TLV encoder, the device envelope gate, and (from #2219) the SIGN_PSBT merkleized-PSBT client. The intent the depositor approves on-device is built here; an encoding bug ships wrong terms to a hardware signer.
- **Rule:** TLV encodings and APDU layouts must cite their firmware/reference-client source and carry golden-vector tests. The envelope gate must reject out-of-range terms with the seam's typed error BEFORE any device I/O. Never log payload bytes. For generated golden vectors — the JSON files under `src/vendor/ledger-bitcoin/__tests__/vectors/` — re-derivation REPLACES this section's author line-walk requirement, and is the only accepted substitute for it: the author declares in the PR which oracle pin (`scripts/requirements.txt`) and firmware-fixtures repo/commit the vectors were generated from, and a reviewer independently regenerates the whole tree into a fresh empty directory per the vendor README ("Regenerating the vectors"), confirms byte-identity with the committed tree (no changed, missing, or extra files beyond the documented exception), and states that result in the review — a provenance claim no reviewer repeated is not provenance. The generators (`scripts/gen_*.py`), `scripts/requirements.txt`, and the recorded pins are source, not fixtures: line-walk them under this section even though they live outside `src/`, and treat any change that alters regenerated bytes — including an oracle-version or fixtures-commit bump — as a change to the vectors themselves. Everything else under `__tests__/`, including golden-test code and hand-recorded expectation values, is line-walked normally.

### 8. Non-standard wallet signing options

- File: `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/utils/signing.ts`
- Uses `useTweakedSigner: false` and `autoFinalized: false` for taproot script-path spends. Wallet support is inconsistent; silent failures produce invalid signatures.
- **Rule:** Validate every signature produced with these flags against the expected sighash before treating the PSBT as signed. Do not rely on the wallet returning success.

### 9. Dependency-free reimplementations of Bitcoin primitives

These paths are registered ahead of the reimplementations landing (see #2228 / #2229). Separating the Ethereum-only paths from the Bitcoin stack means some primitives get reimplemented without `bitcoinjs-lib`, `tiny-secp256k1` or the WASM engine. Each one is small, and each one fails silently: the code compiles, the tests pass, and a wrong address or a wrong on-chain identifier ships.

- Files (all but the last arrive with the optional-BTC work):
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/clients/eth/pegin-transaction.ts` — transaction-id parsing and vault-id derivation, replacing the bitcoinjs and WASM implementations
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/clients/eth/pegin-registration-client.ts` — Ethereum-side registration extracted from `PeginManager`
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/wasm/` — the lazy boundary every WASM-computed value now crosses
  - `packages/babylon-tbv-rust-wasm/src/wasm-loader.ts`, `wasm-loader-node.ts`, `raw.ts`, `raw-node.ts` — the restructured engine entry surface (the `@stability frozen` rules in section 4 still apply)
  - `services/vault/src/utils/btc/scriptPubKeyAddress.ts` — hand-written bech32, bech32m and base58check encoding
  - `packages/babylon-ts-sdk/src/tbv/core/clients/eth/onChainBtcPubkey.ts` — already in the tree, and guarded from now rather than on arrival: it is the sole validator minting `OnChainBtcPubkey`, and the optional-BTC work replaces its `ecc.isXOnlyPoint` curve-membership check with hand-rolled field arithmetic
- **Rule:** A reimplementation may not land without a differential test asserting byte-for-byte equality against the implementation it replaces, over the existing golden vectors **plus** randomised inputs. A single hardcoded vector is not sufficient — it pins one input, not the function. If the original is being deleted in the same change, the differential must run against it before deletion, and the vectors it produced must be committed as fixtures.

## ZERO DEAD CODE POLICY

1. **Never leave dead code.** No unused functions, variables, imports, types, or components — in source or tests.
2. **Never reference removed code.** If something is removed, remove ALL references: tests, imports, re-exports, mocks.
3. **After every edit**, trace the impact: "Is anything I changed or removed still referenced elsewhere?"
4. **No commented-out code.** Delete it. Git has history.
5. **No `// removed`, `// deprecated`, `// unused` comments** as substitutes for actual deletion.
6. **No re-exporting or aliasing** for backward compatibility unless explicitly requested.

---

## CODE QUALITY RULES

### No Magic Numbers

- Extract all hardcoded numbers and strings to named constants with descriptive names.
- Constants should be co-located or in a shared config — never inline.
- If a number appears in code, it must be obvious why that value was chosen.

### No Silent Fallbacks on Critical Paths

- **Throw errors** instead of defaulting to values that mask bugs.
- Never default to `0n`, `0`, `""`, `[]`, or `undefined` when a missing value indicates a real problem.
- Fallback values are acceptable only for optional UI/display concerns, never for financial calculations, transaction construction, or protocol parameters.
- If a value is required for correctness, its absence is an error — surface it loudly.

### Error Handling

- Prefer explicit error handling over catch-all fallbacks.
- Error messages must be actionable — include what failed and what the expected state was.
- Never swallow errors silently (empty `catch {}` blocks).

### Type Safety

- Use strict TypeScript. Avoid `any` — use `unknown` with type narrowing if needed.
- Prefer discriminated unions over optional fields when states are mutually exclusive.
- Null/undefined checks must be explicit, not hidden behind `??` fallbacks on critical paths.

---

## TEST PHILOSOPHY

### Tests test behavior, not implementation

- Each test verifies ONE specific behavior of production code.
- Test name describes the exact behavior being tested.
- If you can't name what production behavior a test verifies, the test shouldn't exist.

### No test bloat

- Never write tests for functions that don't exist in production code.
- When production code changes, update or remove corresponding tests immediately.
- Every assertion must verify behavior of code in `src/`.

### Simplicity over abstraction

- Prefer inline setup over deeply nested helper hierarchies.
- Three similar test functions are better than one parameterized abstraction.
- A new contributor should understand a test by reading it top-to-bottom.

### Self-contained and readable

- Each test makes its setup, action, and assertions clear in the function body.
- Use descriptive names: `it("shows expired with ack_timeout reason", ...)`
- Don't hide critical setup in shared mocks — if it matters for understanding, show it.
- Prefer explicit values over magic constants imported from elsewhere.
- Use `vi.useFakeTimers()` for time-dependent tests.

## ARCHITECTURE & PATTERNS

### Protocol Parameters

- Protocol parameters (councilQuorum, feeRate, etc.) come from on-chain contracts via ABI calls.
- **Never hardcode protocol parameters.** If a value comes from the contract, fetch it.
- If a parameter is not yet available from the contract, leave a `TODO` with context.

### Feature Flags

- Pattern: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_*`
- Defined in `services/vault/src/config/featureFlags.ts`

### Dependencies

- All new dependencies must use **pinned exact versions** (no `^` ranges), especially crypto packages.
- Audit new dependencies for supply chain risk before adding.

### State Management

- React Query for server state (RPC calls, contract reads).
- React Context for shared client state (polling results, form state).
- Avoid prop drilling — use context when 3+ levels deep.

### Performance

- Avoid per-row hook instantiation in tables/lists — centralize polling (see `PeginPollingContext`).
- Memoize derived data with `useMemo`/`useCallback` with correct dependency arrays.
- Don't create new objects/arrays in render without memoization.

### User-Facing Copy

- **All user-visible strings in the vault app live in `services/vault/src/copy.ts`.** That includes JSX text, button labels, modal headings, status/badge labels, step descriptions, toast messages, and any other text a depositor sees.
- **Never inline a new user-facing string in a component or hook.** Add it to `copy.ts` under the appropriate section (or create a new section) and import `COPY` from `@/copy`.
- When editing existing user-facing text, edit it in `copy.ts`. If you find a string still inlined in a component, migrate it to `copy.ts` as part of your change.
- **Exception:** Contract / on-chain error messages live in `services/vault/src/utils/errors/errorMessages.ts`, keyed by ABI error name. Treat that file as part of the copy surface — same review rules apply.
- Follow the style rules documented at the top of `copy.ts` (Pre-Pegin / peg-in conventions, sentence-case status labels, "has been broadcast" tense, American English, vault provider lowercase mid-sentence).
- When adding strings that interpolate values, prefer a function (`(amount: string) => \`Your ${amount}...\``) in `copy.ts` over building the string in the component.

---

## MOTION & ANIMATION

- **Any PR that adds or changes an animation must follow `docs/motion-system.md`** — it is the standard for motion across the monorepo.
- **Tokens, not magic numbers.** Timing/easing/distance are CSS custom properties (`--motion-*`); never inline `ms`/easing/`px` in components.
- **Knobs in core-ui, values in the app.** core-ui animations read `var(--motion-…, <legacy default>)`; an app opts in by defining the token in its `globals.css`. Don't define app-spec tokens in core-ui `:root`.
- **No animation library** (no framer-motion/react-spring) — use the existing mount/unmount seam for exits.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` is mandatory:** handled by a single global `*` animation/transition reset in core-ui `index.css` — no per-token or per-app zeroing. The functional spinner is the one re-enabled exception; JS motion reads `useReducedMotion()`.
- **Never animate `transform` on a popper/tooltip-positioned element** — animate opacity on it, translate on an inner wrapper.

---

## SECURITY

- **Security models live next to the code they describe.** A security-critical component carries a `SECURITY_MODEL.md` at its root, stating what that component must protect, against whom, and under which assumptions. Before changing a component, read the nearest `SECURITY_MODEL.md` at or above the files you are touching. A model that has been reviewed by its component owner is binding: treat its invariants as constraints on the change rather than as a checklist to satisfy afterwards. A model still marked *pending component-owner review* is informative — read it, and raise a conflict with it on the PR rather than treating it as settled. **When no component model exists at or above those files, the repository-level [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) applies** — it covers `packages/babylon-ts-sdk` and `packages/babylon-tbv-rust-wasm` in depth, which is where most of the critical paths above are actually enforced. Component coverage is being added incrementally; the absence of a component model is not evidence that a component is uncritical, and never leaves a change unconstrained.
- **Never log sensitive key material** — no `console.log` of private keys, derived secrets, or signing data.
- **Wallet inputs**: Validate all data received from wallet APIs before use.
- **GraphQL/RPC responses**: Never trust external data for security decisions without validation.

---

## CODE STYLE

- **Format**: Follow ESLint config. Run `pnpm run lint` before every commit.
- **Imports**: Must be used — remove unused imports immediately.
- **Control flow**: Prefer early returns over nested `if`/`else`.
- **Functions**: Keep functions single-purpose. Split when doing unrelated things.
- **Naming**: Descriptive variable and function names. Avoid abbreviations unless domain-standard (tx, UTXO, PSBT).
- **Components**: One component per file. File name matches component name.
- **After changes**: Check for comments/docs that reference old behavior and update them.

## E2E TEST HOOKS (`data-testid`)

- Some `data-testid` attributes in `services/vault/src` are consumed by the real-wallet E2E CLI (`services/vault/e2e/real/`) to drive the depositor lifecycle (pegin / borrow / repay / withdraw). They are load-bearing test infrastructure, not decoration.
- **If you move, rename, or re-implement an element that carries such a `data-testid`, carry the testid over to the equivalent control** — never silently drop it. Removing one breaks the E2E run with no compile error.
- These sites are flagged with an inline comment pointing at the consuming action file; keep that comment attached to the testid.

## General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax
