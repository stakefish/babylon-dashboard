 * `scripts/visual-diff.mjs` already writes, per surface, a `summary.json`
 * plus full-resolution `baseline/`, `candidate/` and `diff/` directories.
 * That report is complete but it only ships as a zipped CI artifact, so in
 * practice nobody looks at it and the PR comment degrades to a list of
 * filenames and percentages.
 *
 * This script closes that gap. For the most-changed screens it stitches the
 * two sides into one before/after PNG under `--out`, and writes a Markdown
 * body under `--body` that embeds those PNGs from `--base-url`. The workflow
 * pushes `--out` to a branch that raw.githubusercontent.com serves, which is
 * what makes the images renderable inside a comment - GitHub cannot embed an
 * image out of a run artifact.
 *
 * Only a slice of the changed screens is embedded (see the caps below), and
 * on a busy run the set is published reduced so that all of it still fits
 * the comment - the artifact keeps the full-resolution originals. The body
 * always also carries the complete text list, so the reviewer can see that
 * the pictures are a sample rather than the whole story.

 * captured here is wider than it (the desktop viewport in
 * `VISUAL_VIEWPORTS`, and `STORY_VIEWPORT` at 900). Neither is pinned to this
 * constant, so a wider capture would start paying the reduction. Either way

 * about it: the caps above bound the count and the dimensions but not the
 * bytes, so five tall vault composites came to 678KB against a 512KB
 * ceiling and the step refused the lot. Refusing is the worst outcome
 * available - the comment falls back to a list of filenames, which is the
 * state this whole script exists to replace - so the size is settled here,
 * where a picture can be made smaller, rather than there, where it can only
 * be dropped.
 *
 * Below the workflow's ceiling rather than equal to it, by a deliberate
 * margin. The two count the same thing - the workflow sums the apparent
 * size of exactly the PNGs written here - so the gap buys nothing but room
 * to be wrong. It is worth having: the run this budget was measured on
 * cleared it by 2KB, and the encoder's output moves with the content of a
 * capture. `visual-embed.test.mjs` pins the margin, not just the order,
 * which is the check that was missing when the ceiling was set.
 *
 * The ladder is walked top down and the first rung the whole set fits under
 * wins, so the ordinary pull request that moves one screen still publishes
 * it at the capture's own width - the reduction is what a busy run pays,
 * not what every run pays. The rungs are sizes worth having rather than a
 * subdivision: 1280 is a desktop capture at life size, 960 and 800 bracket
 * what a comment column actually renders, and 640 is the floor, past which
 * a phone panel in a three-panel composite is 210px wide and the change it
 * is meant to show stops being legible.
 *
 * The ladder buys less than its pixel counts suggest - measured on UI-like
 * content, 1280 to 640 is a 75% pixel cut for around a 28% byte cut - so a
 * busy vault-heavy run can reach the floor and still need to give a picture
 * up. When it does it keeps both surfaces pictured rather than keeping the
 * count up, on the same reasoning as MIN_EMBEDDED_GROUPS_PER_SURFACE: two

 * the story beside it is half size reads as though the small one mattered
 * less, and a per-picture share makes what a reviewer sees depend on how

 *

 * costs 26KB untouched against 45KB at the 640 rung. The walk still takes
 * the widest rung that fits, so a rung that costs more than a wider one can
 * never be chosen.
 *
 * Pictures are given up only once the floor rung is still over budget, and
 * a picture that cannot fit even alone goes first, so one oversized
 * composite cannot take the whole set down with it on the way to being
 * dropped itself.
